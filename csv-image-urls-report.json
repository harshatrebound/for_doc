The knee is a complex joint with several key components working together.</span>},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Femur, Tibia, and Patella: </b>These bones form the knee joint. The femur, or thigh bone, connects to the tibia, the shin bone. The patella, or kneecap, sits in front of the joint, providing protection and aiding movement.},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Articular Cartilage: </b>This smooth tissue covers the ends of bones in the knee, allowing them to glide smoothly against each other. It helps reduce friction during movement.},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Ligaments: </b> Strong bands of tissue, like the ACL and PCL, stabilize the knee by connecting bones. They help control movement and keep the joint aligned.},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Tendons: </b>Tendons attach muscles to bones. The quadriceps tendon connects the thigh muscle to the patella, and the patellar tendon links the kneecap to the tibia. These tendons are vital for kicking, jumping, and running.},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\v0IdQ\\>Each component plays a role in knee function. Ligaments and tendons support and stabilize, while cartilage ensures smooth movement. Knowing how these parts interact helps athletes and coaches understand knee pain better. This knowledge is key to preventing injuries and maintaining performance.</span>},{type:heading,level:2,text:Causes of Knee Pain in Athletes},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\v0IdQ\\>Knee pain is a frequent issue for athletes, often stemming from several key factors. Understanding these can help in managing and preventing pain.</span>},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Overuse Injuries: </b>Continuous stress on the knees from repetitive activities can lead to wear and tear. This is common in sports involving running or jumping.},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Improper Training Techniques: </b>Faulty form or technique during exercises can place undue stress on the knee joint, increasing the risk of pain and injury.},{type:styled_list_item,icon:arrow-right,text:<b style=\\color:#000;\\>Weak Quadriceps: </b>Strong quadriceps are crucial for knee stability.

Fortunately, the majority of ankle ligament injuries heal naturally. However, a small percentage of people may end up with recurrent ankle twisting injuries due to torn ligaments on the outer part of the ankle. Due to recurrent sprains, the individual would often end up lacking the confidence to play. Also, in some cases, they end up sustaining cartilage injuries in the ankle joint due to recurrent strain on the ankle.</span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixGuard wixui-rich-text__text\\>​</span></span><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Old partial tears can be healed by a PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) injection and plaster cast application for 4 weeks. Treatment for the complete tear of the ankle ligaments until recently was a surgery where all the remnants of the torn ligament and the soft tissue around were pulled to overlap and sewed together. There are several shortcomings to this technique. The tissue that is already torn will not have the tensile strength of the natural ligament, as it is like rubber that has been overstretched and has lost its tensile strength. Secondly, when the tissues are overlapped and sutured together, the tension in the whole construct is not easy to gauze. Hence, over or under-tightening is quite common. If over-tightened, the patient will lose the rotational movements. If the ankle LIGAMENT REPAIR is not tightened ENOUGH, the patient is at risk of further ankle sprains. Hence, the new advanced technique of treatment is being performed by Dr. Naveen Kumar LV. He uses natural material grafts harvested from the patient’s body to replicate the tensile strength and provide a stable fixation that lasts for the rest of the patient’s life. He uses a small tendon from the muscle on the inner side of the knee as a graft for this purpose. He drills small tunnels through the outer bone of the ankle. He uses suture anchors to fix the graft to the bone. These suture anchors are made of bio-composite materials or PEEK materials. These bio-composite screws will eventually become bone as well. The cut made to achieve all of this is a small mini-incision. The patient will be in a walking boot for the first 3 weeks to protect the ankle and will be able to return to playing within 3 to 4 months after proper rehabilitation.</span>}]"

It affects more than 180 million people in India, and its prevalence is higher than even diabetes and cancer. There are different types of arthritis, of which the most common are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These diseases worsen with age. Osteoarthritis is the wearing out of the cartilage of the joint due to age, often accelerated by obesity or injury, and commonly affecting the knee. Loss of cartilage increases the friction between bones, causing pain when ascending and descending stairs, walking long distances, and sitting cross-legged. Further erosion causes persistent pain, with the appearance of swelling and crepitus (crackling sound) associated with angular deformities.</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Dr. Rohil shared that exercise is proven to not only reduce symptoms of arthritis but also improve function and reduce wear and tear on the joints in the long run.

While there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to its causes, several factors are known to contribute. These include genetics, age, obesity, and injuries. Dr. Shetty emphasized that prevention plays a crucial role in managing joint health, and regular exercise, such as low-impact activities like swimming or walking, can help maintain joint flexibility and strength. A balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids can reduce arthritis risk. Weight management is also essential, as excess pounds strain joints. Moreover, avoiding excessive stress on joints, proper posture, and ergonomic adjustments in workplaces can minimize the risk of joint diseases.&nbsp;</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>In conclusion, on this World Arthritis Day, Dr. Shetty pledged to continue his “Fight Against Arthritis” by raising awareness and prioritizing joint health through knowledge and proactive measures and further accentuated the need for regular check-ups and early intervention, which make a significant difference in managing arthritis.<br class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>&nbsp;<br class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Dr. Sandeep Kapoor, Director Orthopedics &amp; Health City Hospital, Trauma &amp; Joint Replacement Surgeon, Lucknow</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>The early symptoms of knee arthritis include nagging pain, stiffness, difficulty climbing stairs, or difficulty getting up from a sitting position. These are their mild symptoms, and if you go for an X-ray, it might not show abnormalities initially. As arthritis is a progressive disease, this pain tends to increase. At times, they have a squeaking sound if you put your hand on the knee, which is called crepitus. But in stage 3, patients experience pain even at rest, significant deformity, and impaired daily activities. Stages 1 and 2 involve conservative treatments like exercise, avoiding sitting on the floor, physiotherapy, and supplements. In Stage 2, oral supplements and injections may defer symptoms. Now if we look at the third stage on an X-ray, it is bone and bone. There is a deformity on the X-ray, and it’s a very bizarre-looking X-ray. Stage 3 often requires surgical interventions: osteotomy, partial knee replacement, or total knee replacement. But if everything fails, knee replacement is a successful surgery, and Dr. Sandeep has been doing the surgery for over 24 years. These surgeries promise prolonged joint survival, marking a significant advancement in treatment.</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixGuard wixui-rich-text__text\\>​</span></span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\>Dr. Naveen Kumar LV, MBBS, MS Orth, FRCS Orth (Eng), MCh Hip &amp; Knee (UK), MSc Orth (UK), Dip SICOT (Italy), FEBOT (Portugal), MRCGP (UK), Dip FIFA SM (Switzerland), (FSEM (UK), Sports Orthopedics Institute, Bengaluru</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<br class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\>In simple words, “Yes, arthritis can be cured”. Firstly, one needs to know the types of arthritis and the treatments available for managing arthritis to understand this. The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Osteoarthritis is due to wear and tear of the cartilage lining of the joint. This leads to the raw ends of the bones getting exposed and rubbing against each other. Inflammatory arthritis is due to your own immune system hyper-reacting and fighting against the joint tissues, leading to the arthritis.</span></span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\color_11 wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>In the early stages of osteoarthritis, the problem can be managed with simple exercises, medications to improve the lubrication and quality of cartilage, and braces. Mild to moderate levels of osteoarthritis can still be managed with PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) or lubricant injections. Inflammatory arthritis, when identified in its early stages, can be completely managed with the appropriate medications and exercise-based treatments.

Naveen Kumar LV</span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], September 8: The incidence of Avascular necrosis (AVN) of hips has increased manifolds since the onset of Covid. This condition predominantly affects young and middle-aged people between 20 to 50. It is devastating to see the deterioration in their condition within a span of 6 months to 3 years, ending up needing a Total Hip Replacement at a young age. Timely intervention through an MRI scan and Stem Cell Therapy can help cure this condition and return to an active lifestyle.&nbsp;</span>},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Dr. Naveen Kumar LV at&nbsp;<a class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\ href=\\https://www.sportsorthopedics.in/\\ target=\\_blank\\ rel=\\noreferrer noopener\\>Sports Orthopedics Institute</a>, Bangalore, has specialized in this field and has successfully treated thousands of people with this condition. He has 25 years of vast experience from the UK, Germany and India.

The blood supply to the ball of the thigh bone in the hip area gets affected due to an increase in the pressure in the bone. There are several causes for this, such as smoking, alcoholism, steroid use, diabetes, and radiation therapies can lead to this condition. Once the bone death occurs, the ball will start collapsing and become mushroom-shaped. As the joint congruity gets affected, it leads to arthritis.&nbsp;</span>},{type:heading,level:3,text:CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Avascular necrosis starts as a hip or groin pain. Patients experience a gradual increase in the intensity of pain and stiffness. Patients often seek help after 1 to 2 months post-onset of the pain. If, at this point, it gets diagnosed with a prompt MRI scan, it will usually be in the early stages, either stage 1 or stage 2. In others, the diagnosis gets missed at this stage as appropriate investigations are not conducted. In many others, even after the proper diagnosis of AVN Hips, the treatment gets delayed due to a lack of awareness even among healthcare professionals. When patients arrive at the experts in this field, it is already late if they are in advanced stages, such as stage 3 or stage 4 of AVN Hips. In young patients with stage 1 or stage 2 AVN Hips, a simple procedure called Core Decompression with Stem Cell Therapy cures the condition completely.&nbsp;</span>},{type:heading,level:3,text:HOW IS IT DONE?},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>The surgical procedure is done in 2 stages. In the first instance, a bone marrow biopsy is taken from the lower back. This procedure involves a thick needle aspiration of the bone marrow. The aspirate is sent to the lab to grow a specific line of bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. These cells are multiplied to reach a count of 100 million. This process requires around 4 weeks. Once the cells are ready, a second procedure is performed. This involves a small 3 cm cut on the side of the hip followed by drilling a small tunnel to the ball of the hip joint. The dead bone is cleared. Following this, cultured osteoblast cells are injected into the ball of the hip joint. Post-procedure, 3 weeks rest is recommended. Full recovery occurs in around 4 to 6 months.&nbsp;</span>},{type:heading,level:2,text:ABOUT SPORTS ORTHOPEDICS INSTITUTE},{type:paragraph,text:<span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\><span class=\\wixGuard wixui-rich-text__text\\>​</span></span><span class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\>Sports Orthopedics Institute, steered by Dr. Naveen Kumar LV, offers appropriate treatment for&nbsp;<a class=\\wixui-rich-text__text\\ href=\\https://www.sportsorthopedics.in/avn-hip-treatment\\ target=\\_blank\\ rel=\\noreferrer noopener\\>AVN Hips</a>&nbsp;depending on the stage of AVN.

It is performed to help relieve the pain and stiffness one used to experience due to arthritis of the knee. It is performed with a cut on the front of the knee.

Using cement, the implants are fixed to provide a smooth joint surface.},{type:heading,level:3,text:What is the typical timeline to recover?},{type:paragraph,text:Total Knee Replacement gives you a stable knee which can take weight on directly even on the day 1. The only reason why you feel the pain and stiffness is due to the surgery wound. The soft tissues and skin need time to heal. Your bone and joint will already be ready to take the load on! You can expect to walk without a walker by 2 weeks post surgery. You can expect to walk comfortably outdoors by 4 weeks post surgery. You can expect to climb stairs comfortably by 6 weeks.},{type:heading,level:3,text:What are the common complications of knee replacement?},{type:paragraph,text:Fortunately, serious complications such as infection, clots, implant failure, loosening of implants are rare. However, we often get to hear that the knee replacement was not successful in someone whom the patient knows. Poor success in patient parameters are persistence of pain, stiffness, poor mobility and difficulty in sitting and standing up. The common reason for this is delayed rehabilitation, immobilization post surgery for a prolonged period of time. If a patient is bed bound for the first few weeks post surgery, it becomes extremely hard to mobilize them later. It often occurs due to poor communication regarding the rehabilitation and physiotherapy by the Doctor, over-protective family or non-availability of quality physiotherapists in remote places.},{type:heading,level:3,text:How can I prevent this issue post my TKR surgery?},{type:paragraph,text:Have a thorough discussion with your Surgeon prior to the surgery about the rehabilitation post surgery.

Discuss with your Surgeon and physiotherapists about what are the realistic goals and tentative time frames in which you can expect to achieve.},{type:heading,level:3,text:How can I help improve my outcomes post Surgery?},{type:heading,level:3,text:What happens if I am late and have ended up with stiffness of the knee post surgery?},{type:paragraph,text:If the joint has already become very stiff and the range of movement is not improving with the physiotherapy as well, then you may need manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) to regain the movement. This is a small procedure under anesthesia where the surgeon bends the knee through the full range of movement within a span of 2 to 3 minutes. There will be no cuts made. Post this procedure, you will still need to continue physiotherapy and exercises to sustain the benefits of mobility achieved by manipulation under anasthesia.},{type:paragraph,text:Last but not the least.},{type:paragraph,text:<strong>Remember that physiotherapy and rehabilitation are done by you!
