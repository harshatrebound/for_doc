Based on the audit, here are the CRITICAL issues that need immediate attention, ordered by priority:

1. **Security Critical Issues:**
   - ğŸš¨ JWT_SECRET using fallback value in middleware - this is a major security risk
   - ğŸš¨ Inconsistent admin credentials across files
   - ğŸš¨ Missing input validation in API routes
   - ğŸš¨ Overly permissive CORS ('*')

2. **Build/Deployment Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ Permission issues with .next directory preventing successful builds
   - ğŸš¨ Missing proper environment variable validation
   - ğŸš¨ Development/production environment configuration issues

3. **Core Functionality Gaps:**
   - ğŸš¨ Appointment booking flow is incomplete
   - ğŸš¨ Missing validation for appointment slots (could allow double bookings)
   - ğŸš¨ No error handling for failed API calls in critical flows
   - ğŸš¨ Missing proper status management for appointments

4. **Data Integrity Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ No validation constraints on status fields in database
   - ğŸš¨ Missing transaction handling for critical operations
   - ğŸš¨ No data sanitization for user inputs
   - ğŸš¨ No proper error boundaries for failed state updates

5. **User Experience Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ Missing loading states during critical operations
   - ğŸš¨ No error feedback for failed operations
   - ğŸš¨ No success confirmations for critical actions
   - ğŸš¨ Missing form validations in critical flows

6. **Authentication Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ No session timeout handling
   - ğŸš¨ Missing password security requirements
   - ğŸš¨ No rate limiting on login attempts
   - ğŸš¨ No proper token refresh mechanism

7. **API Security Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ Missing request validation middleware
   - ğŸš¨ No rate limiting on critical endpoints
   - ğŸš¨ Missing proper error responses
   - ğŸš¨ No API versioning

8. **Data Protection Critical:**
   - ğŸš¨ Missing data backup strategy
   - ğŸš¨ No audit logging for critical operations
   - ğŸš¨ Missing data retention policies
   - ğŸš¨ No sensitive data encryption

These issues are considered critical because they affect one or more of:
- System security
- Data integrity
- Core functionality
- User experience in critical paths
- System stability
- Regulatory compliance

Would you like me to create a detailed action plan for addressing any of these critical issues? We should tackle them in order of priority, starting with security and build issues, as they pose the most immediate risks.
