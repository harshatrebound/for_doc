Heading,Symptoms
Heading,Knee pain:
Paragraph,"Knee pain can occur whenever particular activity is performed such as walking, climbing stairs, squatting, cross legged sitting. It can also hurt during rest. The area of pain is also an important characteristic which helps in understanding which structure of the knee has been affected.
Swelling: Swelling indicates that the knee is irritated. This can be due to mechanical causes such as rubbing, inflammation due to wear and tear or injury to the internal structures.
Stiffness: Stiffness can be due to swelling or muscle tightness. If stiffness is not allowing to straighten the knee, it means that something is mechanically blocking the knee from straightening.
Instability: Instability occurs when one or more ligaments of the knee are unable to support the knee well."
