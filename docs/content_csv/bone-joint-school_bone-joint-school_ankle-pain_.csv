Heading,Overview
Paragraph,Ankle is a complex joint where 3 bones come together to form the joint. Twisting of ankle leading to ligament (rubbery structure connecting the two bones) injury is one of the common reasons for the ankle pain. Ankle pain and stiffness can affect the knee as well due to increased stress transmission to the knee.
