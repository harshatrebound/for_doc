Paragraph,Frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a condition in which shoulder movements are restricted in almost all directions. It is a painful condition. It starts gradually.
Heading,Causes
Paragraph,"​Shoulder joint is a ball and a socket joint with a huge range of motion compared to any other joint in the body. It has got a thin capsule along with the ligaments which while holding it in place, will support full range of motion. When the capsule thickens and becomes tighter it causes the stiffness and pain. The exact reason is unknown in majority of these patients. However it is seen more frequently in certain groups of people."
