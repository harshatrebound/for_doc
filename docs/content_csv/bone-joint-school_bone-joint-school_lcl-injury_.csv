Paragraph,"When to seek medical help?Initial assessment, an x-ray and pain relieving medicines is what is needed as an immediate remedy. Further assessment by an expert Arthroscopy Surgeon and MRI scan are necessary to analyze the extent of injury.​What happens to LCL if no treatment is undertaken?​LCL ligament resides outside the knee joint and hence may heal naturally. However, if the knee is not supported well in the first 6 weeks, the chances of natural healing dwindle. A poorly healed LCL ligament will keep causing pain and feeling of giving away whenever there is stress on the knee pushing it outwards while the leg is taking the load. ​What happens when I visit the Consultant?​You will be asked about the nature of injury, symptoms further to that so far. Consultant will examine you and discuss the treatment modalities. ​What are the treatment modalities?​The treatment modalities range from simple ROM Brace immobilisation to PRP injection to LCL ligament reconstruction depending upon the severity of tear, associated injuries and the chronicity of the tear."
