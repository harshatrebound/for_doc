Heading,Diagnosis
Paragraph,"​Avascular necrosis of hip needs assessment of clinical symptoms and careful examination of the hips.
X-ray X-rays can show the changes in the bone in AVN hip. However in early stages x-rays may appear completely normal.
MRI Scan and CT Scan: These two are useful modalities to identify early stages of AVN Hip."
Heading,Treatment
Paragraph,"​Early stages (Stage I and II )AVN hip management includes medications. Medications are known to help to an extent but are usually not sufficient to salvage the problem. Medications prescribed depends on the patient’s condition and other medical issues. Medications routinely used to treat AVN are
Osteoporosis medications. Eg: Alendronate
Anti-cholesterol medications. Eg: Rosuvastatin
Blood thinners. Eg: Ecosprin"
Heading,Surgery
Paragraph,"​As the progression is inevitable in majority of patients, it is prudent to consider conservative bone and cartilage saving surgeries in the early stages of the AVN Hip.
​Core Decompression with Stem Cell Therapy
This is the most advanced way of treating AVN hips as of now. It helps by reducing the pressure and regrowth of the blood vessels. The stem cells therapy help in regrowth of the bone. This procedure is done with small cuts of about 3 cm on the side of the hip. This surgery involves drilling a tunnel into the head of the femur (ball of the thigh bone), removal of the dead bone by curetting followed by injecting the stem cells into the head of the femur through the tunnel. This works well when performed in patients with AVN Hip stage I or II.

Heading,Core Decompression with Bone Transplant
Paragraph,"This is considered to be a good alternative where the bone is of poor quality and needs additional support. However, this needs bone graft to be harvested from the lower leg. Hence, potential risk of graft harvest site pain are an issue. Secondly the risk of graft loosing vascularity needs to be considered.
​Hip Joint Replacement
In patients with advanced hip necrosis with persistent pain and in patients with Stage III and IV AVN Hip, total hip replacement remains as a definitive treatment to achieve a pain free mobile hip."
