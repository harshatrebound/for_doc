Paragraph,"Hamstring injuries are one the commonest injury in athletes. The hamstring muscles aren’t used much while standing or walking, but they’re very active during activities that involve bending the knee, such as running, jumping and climbing. The hamstring tendon injury occurs when the tendons are stretched beyond their limit. They occur particularly with explosive movements such as jumping, sprinting or vaulting.
The word Ham-string means crooked long string like muscles on the back of the thigh. These muscles are more prone to strain as they cross 2 joints, namely the hip and the knee.
The typical injury results from hip flexion and knee extension. The injury can occur either at the junction between the muscle and their tendons or at the proximal attachment to the hipbone in the buttock. The injury may cause sudden pain, popping sensation, loss of strength, swelling and bruise.
Rest, elevation, ice and compression with elastic (Crepe) bandage help heal majority of the Grade 1 and Grade 2 injuries. In addition, simple analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can help allay the pain. Grade 3 injuries with complete tears may need further attention. It is best to get these injuries assessed by the Specialists in the field at the earliest possible opportunity, as the results of early repair are superior to late repairs in those needing surgery for managing the injuries."
