Heading,Arthroscopic Bankart Repair Procedure: A Detail Guide
Heading,Introduction
Paragraph,"Shoulder dislocations can be painful and frustrating, often leading to recurring instability. One of the most common injuries associated with shoulder dislocations is a Bankart lesion, a tear in the labrum at the front of the shoulder socket. If left untreated, it can lead to chronic instability and repeated dislocations.
One of the most effective treatments for this condition is the arthroscopic Bankart repair, a minimally invasive procedure that restores stability to the shoulder. This procedure involves reattaching the torn labrum to the glenoid (shoulder socket) using small anchors and sutures.
In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about the arthroscopic Bankart repair procedure, including the causes of Bankart lesions, the surgical process, recovery, and rehabilitation."
Heading,Understanding Bankart Lesions
Heading,Definition and Causes
Paragraph,"A Bankart lesion occurs when the labrum (a ring of cartilage around the shoulder socket) is torn due to a dislocation or subluxation (partial dislocation) of the shoulder. The injury most commonly happens in young athletes and active individuals involved in contact sports such as football, basketball, and wrestling."
Heading,Common causes of a Bankart lesion include:
Paragraph,"Traumatic shoulder dislocations (falling on an outstretched arm, sports injuries)
Repetitive overhead activities (swimming, baseball pitching, weightlifting)"
Heading,Previous shoulder instability or hypermobility
Heading,How Bankart Lesions Affect Shoulder Stability
Paragraph,"The labrum plays a critical role in keeping the ball of the humerus (upper arm bone) securely within the glenoid socket. When a Bankart lesion occurs, the shoulder loses its natural stability, making future dislocations more likely."
Heading,Symptoms and Diagnosis
Heading,Common symptoms of a Bankart lesion include:
Heading,Persistent shoulder instability or a feeling of looseness
Heading,Recurrent shoulder dislocations
Paragraph,"Pain during movement, especially overhead motions"
Heading,Clicking or popping sounds in the shoulder
Heading,Weakness and reduced range of motion
Heading,Diagnosis
Heading,A doctor typically diagnoses a Bankart lesion through:
Paragraph,"Physical examination: Checking shoulder stability, strength, and range of motion
Imaging tests: MRI (often with contrast dye) and X-rays to confirm labral damage and rule out fractures"
Heading,Indications for Arthroscopic Bankart Repair
Paragraph,"When is Surgery Recommended?
While some minor Bankart lesions may heal with physical therapy and rest, surgery is often recommended in the following cases:"
Heading,Recurrent shoulder dislocations
Heading,Significant instability affecting daily activities
Heading,Athletes or physically active individuals who need full shoulder function
Paragraph,"Failure of non-surgical treatments
Non-Surgical vs. Surgical Treatment
Non-Surgical: Physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and activity modifications may help in mild cases.
Surgical: Arthroscopic Bankart repair is considered when instability persists, or a patient wants to return to high-demand activities."
Heading,Ideal Candidates for the Procedure
Heading,The best candidates for arthroscopic Bankart repair include:
Paragraph,Young athletes (especially under 30 years old)
Heading,People with frequent shoulder dislocations
Heading,Individuals with no significant bone loss or arthritis in the shoulder
Heading,Preoperative Preparation
Heading,Initial Consultation and Evaluation
Heading,"Before surgery, the orthopedic surgeon will:"
Paragraph,Review the patient’s medical history and previous injuries
Heading,Conduct a thorough physical examination
Heading,Discuss expectations and potential risks
Heading,Imaging and Diagnostic Tests
Heading,Common tests before surgery include:
Heading,MRI Scan: To assess the severity of the labral tear
Paragraph,X-rays: To check for fractures or bone loss in the glenoid
Heading,Preparing Mentally and Physically for Surgery
Heading,"To ensure a smooth surgery and recovery, patients should:"
Paragraph,"Stop smoking (as it can slow healing)
Avoid anti-inflammatory medications that may increase bleeding
Arrange for post-surgical assistance (someone to help at home)
Practice one-handed activities (since the arm will be in a sling post-surgery)
Step-by-Step Procedure of Arthroscopic Bankart Repair"
Heading,Anesthesia and Patient Positioning
Paragraph,"The patient is placed under general anesthesia or a nerve block to numb the shoulder.
The surgeon positions the patient in either the beach-chair position (sitting upright) or lateral decubitus position (lying on the side).
Creating Access Points (Portals)
Small incisions (portals) are made to insert the arthroscope (tiny camera) and surgical instruments."
Heading,Visualizing the Shoulder Joint with Arthroscopy
Paragraph,"The arthroscope provides a clear view of the labral tear and surrounding tissues on a monitor.
Saline solution is used to expand the joint for better visibility."
Heading,Cleaning and Preparing the Labrum
Paragraph,The torn labrum and surrounding damaged tissue are cleaned and prepared for reattachment.
Heading,Anchoring the Labrum Back to the Glenoid
Paragraph,"The surgeon uses suture anchors (tiny screws with attached sutures) to reattach the labrum to the glenoid.
The sutures are carefully tied to hold the labrum in place.
Closing and Post-Surgical Care
The incisions are closed with stitches or surgical tape, and the shoulder is placed in a sling to protect the repair."
Heading,Recovery Timeline After Arthroscopic Bankart Repair
Paragraph,"Recovering from arthroscopic Bankart repair requires patience and dedication to rehabilitation. The timeline can vary, but most patients go through distinct phases of recovery.
Immediate Post-Surgery Expectations (First Few Days)
The shoulder is immobilized in a sling for 4 to 6 weeks to allow healing.
Pain and swelling are managed with ice therapy, prescribed pain medications, and anti-inflammatory drugs.
Movements of the operated arm are strictly limited, with only slight passive movements allowed.
Early Recovery Phase (Weeks 1–6)
Patients begin gentle passive range of motion (ROM) exercises under the guidance of a physical therapist.
Avoid any lifting, pushing, or pulling with the affected arm.
Focus is on reducing swelling and maintaining flexibility.
Intermediate Recovery Phase (Weeks 6–12)
The sling is removed, and active-assisted ROM exercises begin.
Gradual strengthening of shoulder muscles using light resistance bands and weights.
Continued avoidance of high-impact activities or overhead movements.
Advanced Recovery Phase (Months 3–6)
Progressive strengthening exercises to restore full range of motion and stability.
Sport-specific exercises may begin, depending on healing progress.
Return to low-impact sports and activities around 4 to 5 months post-surgery.
Full Recovery and Return to Sports (6+ Months)
Most athletes can return to competitive sports after 6–9 months.
Strength, endurance, and flexibility should be restored before resuming high-impact activities."
