Heading,Overview
Paragraph,"ATFL or Anterior Talo Fibular Ligament is one of the 3 main ligaments on the outer side of the ankle joint. It is a rubbery rope that holds the 2 bones together. ATFL along with its fellow ligaments CFL and PTFL stabilses the ankle on the outer side.
ATFL being in the front part of the ankle on the outer side, protects the joint against inward twisting forces particularly when the ankle is bent downwards.
Why & how does it happen?
ATFL tear are one of commonest injuries to the ankle joint. It typically happens when the ankle and foot gets twisted inwards and the body load falls on the twisted ankle. When the twisting forces overwhelm what the ATFL can manage, the CFL tear occurs. It often occurs due to missing a step on the stairs, or on the playground.
Who gets this injury?
Women are more prone to this injury. It is common not only in sporting population but also in general public. Fall from the two wheelers, bikes and cycles are another common reason for this injury. Typical age group is 20 to 50 years."

Natural History (Progression of disease in the absence of treatment)
ATFL has got the potential to self heal, however proper treatment is necessary. For the ligament to heal, an average of 4 to 6 weeks is required. Upto 6 months your body will keep trying to heal this ligament. After that if the laxity persists, that may remain so for rest of the life unless an intervention takes place. If the ATFL does not heal or if it heals with a stretch, then it is likely to buckle repeatedly and cause further ankle injuries. In addition, sitting cross legged continues to cause pain if ATFL has not healed well.
When to seek medical help?
Initial assessment, an x-ray and pain relieving medicines is what is needed as an immediate remedy. Further assessment by an expert Orthopedic Surgeon is useful. Most ATFL injuries do not need an MRI scan during the initial phase of treatment. ​
What happens when I visit the Consultant?
You will be asked about the nature of injury, symptoms further to that so far. Consultant will examine you and discuss the treatment modalities.
What are the treatment Modalities?
The treatment modalities vary from simple ankle binder to PRP Injection to Ankle Ligament Surgery depending upon the grade of tear and the chronicity."
