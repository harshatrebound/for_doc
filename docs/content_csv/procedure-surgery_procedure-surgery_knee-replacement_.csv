Paragraph,"Any surgery would involve certain risks however the risks with the knee replacement are low.
Fracture: During the surgery there is a small risk of fracture of the bone around the site of implants. Small fractures usually heal. Larger fractures though rare, may need further fixation with plates or wires.
Infection: Risk of infection is low with the advanced techniques and improvised theatre environment. Infection if picked up early, are likely to respond to antibiotics. In some instances it may need further washout or even removal of the implant.
Nerve Damage: Rare, but can lead to numbness or weakness down the leg. In most patients, that recovers within 3 months.
Clots in legs and lungs: To prevent clots (Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), medications are given for first 45 days post-surgery.
Stiffness: Stiffness of the muscles is common post-surgery and needs good physiotherapy support.
Loosening of the implants: This is expected to happen in some patients usually after 15 years post-surgery. If it becomes painful, may then need a revision knee replacement surgery."
