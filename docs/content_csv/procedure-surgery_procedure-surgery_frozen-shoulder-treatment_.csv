Paragraph,Frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a condition of shoulder in which the capsule has become very stiff and tight leading to pain and limitation of the motion.
Heading,Diagnosis
Paragraph,"​It is a clinical examination based diagnosis in most cases.
X-ray: . X-ray in frozen shoulder is useful to rule out the osteoarthritis of the shoulder joint and fractures around the shoulder joint.
MRI Scan: . MRI Scan shows certain signs such as thickening of Coraco-humeral ligament which is one of the reliable signs to confirm frozen shoulder."
Heading,Treatment
Heading,Pain management & Exercises
Paragraph,"Controlling the pain with short course of medication and / or physiotherapy can help in facilitating the frozen shoulder exercises which are vital to improve the range of movement and pain. Applying heat before exercises can help to stretch better.
​Steroid injection to the joint
In patients with severe pain stopping them from doing the exercises, it can be a useful tool to help. However, post injection exercises still have to be done regularly to get the motion back.
​Manipulation under anaesthesia with steroid injection
Manipulation under general anaesthesia will help to bring the range of motion back and injection helps the pain. Post this, exercises are still required, but it will be a lot easier to do the exercises to maintain the range of motion.
​Arthroscopic release of Anterior capsule
In patients with persistent shoulder stiffness for prolonged period, an arthroscopic (keyhole) surgery to release the tight bands can help restore the range of motion."
