One of the common areas it affects is the hip joint. The upper portion of the thigh bone is in the shape of a ball and forms a joint with the socket of the pelvic bone. These to bone ends together is called hip joint. The ball or head of the thigh bone (femur) has got the blood supply in a reverse fashion from the neck upwards. The blood vessels around the neck of the femur form a ring from which blood vessels travel upwards to the head of the femur. When the pressure increases in the capsule of the joint, it obstructs the blood supply. This leads to the death of the bone in the head area which is called necrosis. Necrosed bone will not be able to support the cartilage (the lining of the joint) and hence starts collapsing. As the bone collapses the shape of the ball starts changing.
