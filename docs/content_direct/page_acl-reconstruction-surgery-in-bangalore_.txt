Introduction to ACL Reconstruction and Its Importance
A torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is a common knee injury that can sideline you from sports and even make everyday activities difficult. The ACL is a key knee ligament that stabilizes your knee during pivoting and sudden movements. When it’s torn (often during sports like football, basketball, or accidents), the knee can buckle or feel unstable. This not only impairs your performance but can also lead to further damage (like meniscus tears or early arthritis) if left untreated.
ACL reconstruction surgery is a specialized knee ligament surgery designed to restore stability to an ACL-deficient knee. This procedure replaces the damaged ACL with a new tissue graft, effectively creating a new ligament. This surgery is often crucial for athletes and active individuals who want to return to sports and anyone experiencing knee instability in daily life. By reconstructing the ACL, patients can regain confidence in their knee, prevent recurrent injuries, and protect the joint’s long-term health.

ACL Reconstruction Techniques and Graft Options
ACL reconstruction is not a one-size-fits-all procedure. Dr. Naveen employs various techniques and graft types based on what’s best for each patient. Two key aspects define an ACL surgery: the graft choice (what tissue is used to create the new ligament) and the surgical technique (how the graft is placed and fixed in the knee). Below, we break down the options and advanced techniques used in ACL surgeries:
Graft Options for ACL ReconstructionThe “graft” is the tissue that will become your new ACL. We will help you choose the ideal graft depending on your age, activity level, and preferences. Common ACL graft choices include:
Hamstring Tendon Autograft: This is one of the most popular grafts. It uses two of your own hamstring tendons (taken from the back of your thigh). Hamstring grafts allow strong ligament reconstruction with relatively small incisions. Patients often have less front-knee pain compared to other grafts, and the strength of a well-prepared hamstring graft is excellent for returning to sports.
Patellar Tendon Autograft (Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone): This technique uses the middle third of your own patellar tendon (just below the kneecap), along with small pieces of bone attached at each end. It has been a “gold standard” for athletes because the bone-to-bone healing can make the graft very secure. Patellar tendon grafts are extremely strong and have a high success rate for athletes in high-demand sports. The trade-off is that some patients might experience temporary pain in the front of the knee or discomfort when kneeling during recovery.
Quadriceps Tendon Autograft: The quadriceps tendon (above the kneecap) is another autograft option, sometimes taken with a small piece of bone. It provides a thick, robust graft—useful in patients who need a larger graft or in revision (repeat) ACL surgeries. Dr. Naveen might choose a quad tendon graft if you have had a previous ACL surgery or if your build and activity needs suggest this as a better option. Many patients tolerate this graft well with low risk of long-term pain.
Allograft (Donor Tissue): In some cases, an allograft (a tendon from a donor/cadaver) may be used. The benefit is that it avoids taking your own tissue, so your own muscles and tendons remain untouched. This can mean a shorter initial surgery and less post-operative discomfort at the harvest site. However, allografts generally take longer to fully incorporate and heal into the bone, and they might have a slightly higher failure rate in young athletic individuals. Dr. Naveen typically reserves allografts for specific situations – such as certain revision surgeries or for older, less active patients – and only uses allograft from highly screened sources to ensure safety.
Synthetic Ligament Grafts: Newer artificial ligament materials (synthetic grafts) have been developed to replace the ACL. While not common, they may be an option in select cases or clinical trials. Synthetic grafts (like the LARS ligament) can offer the advantage of immediate strength and quicker surgery, but historically some have had issues with long-term failure. Dr. Naveen will discuss if a synthetic graft is appropriate or if sticking to biological tissue is the better choice for you (in most cases, your own tissue or a donor tissue is preferred for best healing).
Advanced Surgical TechniquesIn all ACL reconstructions performed by Sports Orthopedics, arthroscopic surgery is the standard. This means the procedure is done through small keyhole incisions using a camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments, rather than a large open incision. Arthroscopy leads to less pain, minimal scarring, and faster recovery. Within the realm of arthroscopic ACL surgery, there are a few advanced techniques and innovations that Dr. Naveen utilizes:
Anatomic ACL Reconstruction: This isn’t a specific “technique” but a principle Dr. Naveen follows. It means the new ACL is placed in the exact original anatomic position of your natural ACL. By drilling tunnels in the correct anatomical spots on the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), the reconstructed ligament can restore more natural knee mechanics. This leads to better stability, especially for pivoting movements, and reduces the risk of re-injury.
All-Inside ACL Reconstruction: In a traditional ACL surgery, one end of the graft is often fixed with a screw inside the bone. In an all-inside technique, special sockets (rather than full tunnels) are created in the bones, and the graft is anchored with small, strong buttons on both the femur and tibia. The all-inside approach uses even smaller bone openings and can preserve more bone stock. It often results in less post-op pain at the bone sites and can allow the surgeon to double-loop the hamstring graft to make it thicker. Dr. Naveen may use the all-inside method to maximize graft strength while minimizing tissue trauma, depending on the case.
Double-Bundle ACL Reconstruction: The ACL has two functional bundles of fibers (anteromedial and posterolateral). In certain patients (like high-level athletes or if anatomy calls for it), Dr. Naveen can perform a double-bundle ACL reconstruction, which uses two separate smaller grafts to recreate both bundles of the ACL. The goal is to mimic the knee’s natural anatomy more closely, potentially giving improved rotational stability. This is a more complex technique and not necessary for every patient, but Dr. Naveen is experienced in it for cases that warrant a double-bundle approach.
Internal Brace Augmentation: For additional support, especially in high-demand athletes or in repair of certain acute ACL tears, Dr. Naveen may use an internal brace. The internal brace is a strong synthetic fiber tape that is implanted alongside the new ACL graft. Think of it as a reinforcement – it helps protect and stabilize the healing graft during the first few critical months. Important: The internal brace is not a replacement for the actual graft; it’s an augmentation to provide extra stability while your tissue heals and strengthens. This technique can potentially allow for a more confident early rehabilitation. Dr. Naveen will consider using an internal brace if it can benefit your recovery (for example, if your ligament tissue quality allows for a partial repair with augmentation, or if you are eager to safely accelerate your rehab).
The Surgeon will discuss all these options with you before surgery. Rest assured, he is proficient in all the modern ACL reconstruction techniques and will customize the procedure to what best fits your knee condition and lifestyle. Whether it’s choosing the right graft or employing the latest surgical method, the goal is to ensure you have a stable knee that heals well and serves you in the long run.
What to Expect Before, During, and After ACL Surgery
Facing surgery can be intimidating, but knowing what to expect can help ease your mind. At our Bangalore clinic, we believe in guiding you through every step of the process – before, during, and after your ACL reconstruction – so you feel comfortable and prepared.
Before Surgery (Preparation and Prehab)
Thorough Evaluation: First, Dr. Naveen will perform a detailed evaluation of your knee. This includes a physical examination and usually an MRI scan to confirm the ACL tear and check for any other injuries (such as meniscus or cartilage damage) that might need attention during surgery. You’ll discuss your medical history, activity goals, and any concerns.
Prehabilitation (“Prehab”): If time allows (for example, if your injury is not extremely recent or if swelling needs to subside), you may be advised to do some prehab exercises with a physiotherapist before surgery. Prehab focuses on gently restoring your knee’s range of motion and strengthening the muscles (especially quadriceps and hamstrings). Going into surgery with a knee that can straighten and bend reasonably well, and with good muscle tone, can actually improve your post-surgery recovery speed. Don’t worry if your knee still feels unstable – you’ll typically wear a brace or be cautious to avoid buckling it during this period.
Preparation and Planning: Dr. Naveen will explain the surgical plan, including the likely graft choice and technique tailored for you. This is a great time to ask any questions about the procedure. You’ll also get instructions for the day of surgery, such as fasting (not eating) for a certain period before the procedure, arranging for someone to drive you home, and preparing your home for post-op comfort (for example, getting ice packs, setting up a rest area, etc.). Our team will make sure all necessary blood tests and medical clearances (like fitness for anesthesia) are done prior to your surgery date.
During Surgery (The Procedure Day)
Admission and Anesthesia: On the day of surgery, you’ll be admitted to the hospital or day-surgery center. ACL reconstruction is typically done under regional (spinal) anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia – meaning you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will discuss the best option for you. Many patients receive a spinal anesthesia (numbing from the waist down) combined with light sleep sedation, so you stay comfortable and pain-free.
Arthroscopic Procedure: Dr. Naveen performs the ACL reconstruction arthroscopically. Through 2-3 tiny incisions around your knee, a small camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments are inserted. First, any additional injuries are addressed – for example, trimming or stitching a torn meniscus if needed. Then, the remnants of the torn ACL are cleared out.
Graft Harvest and Placement: If using an autograft (your tissue), the graft will be harvested through a small incision (for example, a short cut over the upper shin for a hamstring graft, or over the knee for a patellar graft). This incision is kept as small as possible. The graft is prepared to the correct length and thickness. Next, Dr. Naveen will drill precise tunnels or sockets in your thigh and shin bones at the anatomic ACL attachment sites. The prepared graft is then passed through the knee and fixed securely into these bone tunnels – usually with devices like strong absorbable screws or suspensory buttons. (In an all-inside technique, as mentioned earlier, the fixation might be done entirely with buttons on both ends.) Dr. Naveen ensures the graft is properly tensioned (tight but not over-tight) and that your knee has full range of motion without impingement of the graft.
Duration and Wake Up: The surgery typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, though it can vary depending on complexity (for example, if we also repair other ligaments or a meniscus, it could be a bit longer). After the procedure, you’ll be moved to a recovery room as the anesthesia wears off. Don’t be surprised if you wake up with a padded bandage on your knee and maybe a brace; this is normal. Our team will monitor you until you’re fully awake and comfortable.
Same-Day Discharge: ACL reconstruction is often a day-care surgery, meaning many patients go home the same day once they recover from anesthesia. In some cases, an overnight stay might be recommended (especially if surgery is done late in the day or if additional procedures were performed). Either way, you won’t be in the hospital for long.
After Surgery (Recovery and Rehabilitation)
Immediate Post-Op: When you go home, your knee will be wrapped and possibly in a knee brace locked in a straight position (depending on Dr. Naveen’s instructions and whether any other repairs were done). You’ll likely be given crutches or a walker for support. Pain is managed with medications – expect some soreness, but many patients find it’s less than they anticipated thanks to modern arthroscopic techniques and pain control methods. We’ll advise you on icing the knee regularly to keep swelling down.
Weight-Bearing and Mobility: Surprisingly, you will be encouraged to start moving the same day or next day. In many cases, if only the ACL was reconstructed and the knee is stable, you can start walking with support almost immediately (typically with crutches or a walker for balance). Dr. Naveen often allows partial to full weight-bearing as tolerated right after surgery, especially if no other structures (like meniscus) need protection. For the first week, you’ll use support and avoid long periods on your feet, but basic walking around the house is encouraged. By the end of the first week, many patients can put more weight on the leg and may even begin walking short distances without support (if advised by the doctor or physio). Everyone is a bit different, so follow the specific guidance given to you.
Follow-Up and Physiotherapy: You’ll have a follow-up appointment within a week or two after surgery. Stitches (if any external ones) will be removed around 10-14 days. The physiotherapy (rehab) program starts almost immediately in the first week. Initially, the focus is on gentle exercises to regain knee range of motion (especially achieving full straightening and gradual bending) and to prevent muscle stiffness. A physiotherapist will teach you exercises and monitor your progress. Strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstrings begin in a controlled way. By 4-6 weeks, the goal is usually to have near-normal walking without aids, full extension and a good bend in the knee, and improving muscle strength.
Rehabilitation Phases
Weeks 0-6: Protective phase
reduce swelling, restore motion, begin basic strength exercises. You’ll work on straightening the knee fully and bending it to at least 90-120 degrees gradually.
3 to 6 Months: Advanced training
higher level strengthening, agility drills, and gentle sport-specific movements under guidance.
Weeks 6-12: Strength and balance phase
more intensive strengthening of the leg muscles, balance training, and core strengthening.
6 to 9 Months: Return to sport
Most patients are ready to carefully return to full sports or intense physical activities around the 6-8 month mark post-surgery with doctor’s approval.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do I know if I have torn my ACL?
A torn ACL often happens with a sudden twisting injury to the knee – for example, landing from a jump and twisting, or a quick change of direction while running. Patients often report hearing or feeling a “pop” in the knee at the moment of injury. Other common symptoms include immediate swelling of the knee (within the first few hours), pain (especially deep inside the knee), and a feeling of instability or “giving way” when you try to put weight on that leg. However, not all ACL tears cause severe pain after the initial injury – some people just notice the instability later when they return to activity.
If you suspect an ACL tear, it’s important to see a doctor. Dr. Naveen will perform specific clinical tests on your knee (like the Lachman test or pivot shift test) to check the ACL. An MRI scan is usually ordered to confirm the diagnosis, as it can visualize the ACL and also reveal any other injuries (like meniscus tears or bone bruises) that might have occurred with the ACL tear. In summary, if your knee swelled up after an injury and now feels wobbly or unreliable, you should get it evaluated for a possible ACL tear.
Does a torn ACL always require surgery?
Not always – it depends on your lifestyle and the degree of instability. An ACL tear will not heal on its own (since the ligament ends retract and there’s poor blood supply), but not everyone needs surgery. If you are a very sedentary person or willing to give up pivoting sports, and if your knee feels generally stable in straight-line activities, you might manage without surgery. The treatment in such cases is focused on physiotherapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles (especially quads and hamstrings) to compensate for the missing ACL, and possibly wearing a brace during high-risk activities. Some people can cope with an ACL-deficient knee for everyday life, especially older individuals or those with very low activity demands.
However, if you’re young or active, or if you experience your knee “giving way” even during simple tasks, surgery is often strongly recommended. Repeated instability episodes can cause further damage like cartilage wear or meniscus tears. For anyone who wants to return to sports, running, or an active lifestyle, an ACL reconstruction is usually the best solution to restore full stability. Dr. Naveen will assess your knee and discuss your activity goals – if you aim to get back to a sport or high-demand activities, he will likely advise that reconstruction surgery is the safest route to protect your knee long-term.
Who should consider ACL reconstruction surgery?
You should consider ACL reconstruction if you have a torn ACL and any of the following apply to you:
You are an athlete or recreational sportsperson who wants to return to sports that involve cutting, jumping, or quick direction changes (e.g., football, basketball, tennis, badminton, etc.).
Your knee feels unstable or gives way during everyday activities (going down stairs, stepping off a curb, turning while walking). Even if you’re not an athlete, instability in daily life is problematic and can risk further injury.
You have additional injuries (like a meniscus tear) that were treated, but the knee might still be unstable without an ACL.
You are relatively young or otherwise active and wish to maintain an active lifestyle without restricting yourself due to fear of the knee giving out.
You’ve tried conservative management (therapy, bracing) for a while and still have instability or lack of confidence in your knee.
In contrast, if you’re older or have very low activity demands and your knee isn’t buckling, you might elect not to have surgery. Ultimately, the decision is personalized. Dr. Naveen will help you weigh the pros and cons based on your situation. His goal is to ensure that if you do undergo ACL reconstruction, you truly need it and will benefit from it.
What happens if I don’t get ACL surgery for a torn ACL?
If you choose not to have surgery and you have an ACL tear, the main concern is ongoing knee instability. Without the ACL, your knee may continue to give way at unpredictable times, especially with any sudden turns or awkward steps. This is not just a functional problem; it can lead to further damage inside the knee. Every time the knee buckles, there’s a risk of secondary injuries like tearing the meniscus (the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee) or damaging the articular cartilage (which can eventually lead to arthritis). In fact, many chronic ACL-deficient knees develop meniscus tears over time due to the repeated stress and sliding in the joint.
Additionally, you might have to significantly modify your activities. Sports that involve pivoting or jumping would likely be off-limits. Even hiking on uneven terrain or dancing can become risky. Some people adapt by giving up these activities or by wearing a stabilizing brace during them, but it’s a compromise.
That said, if your knee is mostly stable in straight-line activities and you are disciplined about avoiding high-risk movements, you might do okay without an ACL. You would need to maintain strong leg muscles through exercise to help compensate for the lost ligament. Regular check-ups would be wise to monitor knee health. Dr. Naveen may recommend a structured rehab and a trial of non-surgical management to see if you can cope. If it becomes clear that instability is affecting your quality of life, you can always decide to proceed with surgery later. Keep in mind, though, if too much time passes with ongoing instability, any new damage (like a large meniscus tear) could make the eventual surgery and recovery more complex.
How is ACL reconstruction surgery performed?
ACL reconstruction is performed arthroscopically (through small incisions using a camera). The general steps are:
Arthroscopic Evaluation: After you’re under anesthesia, Dr. Naveen makes two or three tiny incisions around the knee. Saline fluid is used to expand the knee joint, and a fiber-optic camera is inserted so the inside of your knee can be seen on a monitor. He will inspect all structures in the knee joint – ACL (confirm it’s torn), PCL, both menisci, cartilage surfaces, etc. Any loose fragments from the torn ACL are removed.
Address Additional Injuries: If there are any co-injuries (for example, a torn meniscus or a cartilage flap), those are addressed first. A meniscus tear might be trimmed (meniscectomy) or stitched (meniscus repair) depending on its type and location. This ensures the knee is “cleaned up” and ready for the new ACL.
Graft Harvest: If an autograft is being used (like your hamstring or patellar tendon), a small incision is made to obtain that graft. For a hamstring graft, two small tendons are carefully detached from the hamstring muscle and pulled out; they are then cleaned and bundled to form a strong new “ligament”. For a patellar tendon graft, a strip of tendon with small bone blocks is removed. These procedures are done meticulously to avoid unnecessary injury to surrounding tissues.
Tunnel Creation: Dr. Naveen then creates tunnels or sockets in the tibia (shin bone) and femur (thigh bone) at the sites where the ACL normally attaches. This is done with specialized guides to ensure accurate placement. Proper tunnel placement is critical for the new ACL to function like a natural ligament. In the anatomic technique, these are placed exactly where your original ACL was.
Graft Placement: The prepared graft is then passed through the tunnels. For example, a hamstring graft, which looks like a thick rope by now, is pulled into place so that it spans the knee joint, inside the position of the old ACL.
Fixation: The graft must be secured at both ends so it stays taut and heals in place. Depending on the technique, this is done by various methods:
A common method is to use an interference screw (often a bio-absorbable screw that will eventually dissolve) inside the bone tunnel on the tibia to wedge the graft in place, and a small strong button on the femur that sits on the outer cortex of the bone, suspending the graft.
In an all-inside technique, as described earlier, buttons may be used on both ends. In a patellar tendon graft, sometimes screws are used on both ends to fix the bony parts into the tunnels.
Dr. Naveen will also test the knee through a range of motion to ensure the graft is secure and the knee moves well without pinching the graft.
Closure: Once the new ACL is in place and everything looks good, the small incisions are closed (a couple of stitches or steri-strips). The knee is bandaged and often a brace is applied to keep it straight initially.
The entire surgery is usually completed within 1-2 hours. It’s amazing that such a complex procedure can be done through tiny incisions — thanks to modern arthroscopy and Dr. Naveen’s skilled hands. Patients often go home the same day. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, the post-operative pain and stiffness are much less than older, open-knee techniques.
