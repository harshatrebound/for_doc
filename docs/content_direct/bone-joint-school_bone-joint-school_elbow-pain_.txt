Elbow pain can affect all age groups. The reasons for the elbow pain can be due to variety of conditions such as injury, infection, muscle strains and arthritis.
Symptoms
Elbow pain. Elbow pain can occur whenever particular activity is performed such as bending, lifting, turning
or twisting the elbow.Â In certain conditions it can also hurt during rest. The area of pain is also an important characteristic which helps in understanding which structure in and around the elbow has been affected.
Swelling:
Swelling indicates that the elbow joint is irritated. This can be due to mechanical causes such as rubbing, inflammation due to wear and tear or injury to the internal structures.
Stiffness: Stiffness can be due to swelling or muscle tightness. If stiffness is not allowing to straighten the elbow, it means that something is mechanically blocking the knee from straightening.
Instability: Instability occurs when one or more ligaments of the knee are unable to support the elbow.
