However, a small percentage of people may end up with recurrent ankle twisting injuries due to torn ligaments on the outer part of the ankle.

Treatment for the complete tear of the ankle ligaments until recently was a surgery where all the remnants of the torn ligament and the soft tissue around were pulled to overlap and sewed together. There are several shortcomings to this technique. The tissue that is already torn will not have the tensile strength of the natural ligament, as it is like rubber that has been overstretched and has lost its tensile strength. Secondly, when the tissues are overlapped and sutured together, the tension in the whole construct is not easy to gauze. Hence, over or under-tightening is quite common. If over-tightened, the patient will lose the rotational movements. If the ankle LIGAMENT REPAIR is not tightened ENOUGH, the patient is at risk of further ankle sprains. Hence, the new advanced technique of treatment is being performed by Dr. Naveen Kumar LV. He uses natural material grafts harvested from the patient's body to replicate the tensile strength and provide a stable fixation that lasts for the rest of the patient's life. He uses a small tendon from the muscle on the inner side of the knee as a graft for this purpose. He drills small tunnels through the outer bone of the ankle. He uses suture anchors to fix the graft to the bone. These suture anchors are made of bio-composite materials or PEEK materials. These bio-composite screws will eventually become bone as well. The cut made to achieve all of this is a small mini-incision. The patient will be in a walking boot for the first 3 weeks to protect the ankle and will be able to return to playing within 3 to 4 months after proper rehabilitation.</span>""}]",2025-04-06T06:27:43.900Z

Osteoarthritis is the wearing out of the cartilage of the joint due to age, often accelerated by obesity or injury, and commonly affecting the knee.

At times, they have a squeaking sound if you put your hand on the knee, which is called crepitus. But in stage 3, patients experience pain even at rest, significant deformity, and impaired daily activities. Stages 1 and 2 involve conservative treatments like exercise, avoiding sitting on the floor, physiotherapy, and supplements. In Stage 2, oral supplements and injections may defer symptoms. Now if we look at the third stage on an X-ray, it is bone and bone. There is a deformity on the X-ray, and it's a very bizarre-looking X-ray. Stage 3 often requires surgical interventions: osteotomy, partial knee replacement, or total knee replacement.

In others, the diagnosis gets missed at this stage as appropriate investigations are not conducted. In many others, even after the proper diagnosis of AVN Hips, the treatment gets delayed due to a lack of awareness even among healthcare professionals. When patients arrive at the experts in this field, it is already late if they are in advanced stages, such as stage 3 or stage 4 of AVN Hips.

The aspirate is sent to the lab to grow a specific line of bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. These cells are multiplied to reach a count of 100 million. This process requires around 4 weeks. Once the cells are ready, a second procedure is performed. This involves a small 3 cm cut on the side of the hip followed by drilling a small tunnel to the ball of the hip joint. The dead bone is cleared. Following this, cultured osteoblast cells are injected into the ball of the hip joint. Post-procedure, 3 weeks rest is recommended.
