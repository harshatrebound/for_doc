Each knee has two menisci – one on the inner side (medial meniscus) and one on the outer side (lateral meniscus). These structures serve as cushions between your femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), ensuring that your knee moves smoothly and efficiently. Imagine them like the tires of a car: small but crucial. Without them, every step would be harsher, and your bones would wear down over time.</span>""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">The meniscus not only helps with load distribution but also with joint lubrication and proprioception – your sense of joint position and movement.

These injuries are more common than you’d think and affect people of all ages.</span>""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">Whether you’re a professional athlete or someone who twisted their knee during a simple walk, understanding the anatomy of your meniscus is the first step toward managing a tear effectively.</span>""},{""type"":""heading"",""level"":3,""text"":""Causes of Meniscus Tears""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">There’s a whole list of ways to injure your meniscus, but let’s narrow it down to the top culprits. Sports injuries are a big one—twisting or turning your knee quickly, especially with the foot planted and the knee bent, is a textbook way to tear a meniscus. Basketball, soccer, tennis, and football players are often the unlucky victims. One wrong pivot, and boom—your knee gives out.</span>""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">But sports aren’t the only danger zone. Everyday movements like squatting, kneeling, or lifting something heavy with improper form can do the trick too. As we age, the meniscus weakens and thins out, making it more susceptible to tears even from minor activities. That’s why you’ll hear about older adults tearing a meniscus just from standing up awkwardly or slipping slightly.</span>""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">There are also degenerative tears, which occur gradually over time due to wear and tear.

Unlike some other types of tears, radial tears usually don’t heal on their own because they occur in the “white zone” of the meniscus, which has limited blood supply. Without enough blood flow, the body struggles to repair the damaged tissue.</span>""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""<span style=\""font-weight: 400;\"">Because they compromise the structural integrity of the meniscus, untreated radial tears can lead to further damage and even accelerate joint degeneration.
