              <strong>Total Hip Replacement (THR)</strong> or <em>hip arthroplasty</em> is a surgical procedure in which the damaged ball-and-socket structure of the hip joint is replaced with high-quality artificial components. The natural hip joint consists of the femoral head (the ball) and the acetabulum (the socket). When these surfaces are worn out due to arthritis, injury, or disease, they cause pain, stiffness, and difficulty in movement.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              THR restores normal joint mechanics using prosthetic implants made of metal alloys, ceramics, and medical-grade polyethylene. These components replicate the function of a healthy hip, reduce pain, and dramatically improve mobility and quality of life.

                <strong>Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</strong> (loss of blood supply to the femoral head)

            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              Total hip replacement is typically recommended when other treatments — like oral medications, steroid injections, or physiotherapy — no longer provide adequate pain relief or joint function. It is especially important for patients whose quality of life is severely affected by hip conditions.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2 sm:mb-3 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>

                Suffer from a visible or noticeable <strong>limp</strong> or rely heavily on walking sticks or walkers

              <li>
                Have <strong>radiological evidence</strong> of joint degeneration, such as cartilage loss, femoral head collapse (as in AVN), or osteophyte formation

              <li>
                Struggle with tasks such as putting on shoes, standing from a seated position, or getting in and out of vehicles

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              It's important to note that delaying surgery can lead to worsening joint deformities, muscle wasting, and more complex recovery. Early surgical intervention, when appropriate, allows for better implant positioning, faster healing, and an easier return to normal activity.

                1. Osteoarthritis of the Hip
              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Osteoarthritis is the most common reason for hip replacement. It is a degenerative joint disease that causes the cartilage cushioning the bones to wear away over time. As the cartilage deteriorates, the bones rub against each other, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Patients often experience difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or performing daily activities. Osteoarthritis usually develops with age but can be accelerated by prior injuries or a sedentary lifestyle.

              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Also known as osteonecrosis, AVN occurs when blood supply to the femoral head (the ball of the hip joint) is disrupted, leading to bone death and structural collapse. AVN can develop due to trauma, long-term steroid use, alcohol abuse, or unknown causes. Early stages may present as mild discomfort, but the pain intensifies as the condition progresses, eventually requiring surgical intervention. If diagnosed early, AVN may be managed with joint-preserving techniques; however, advanced cases often necessitate total hip replacement.

              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that causes chronic inflammation of the joint lining, resulting in pain, swelling, and joint erosion. Unlike osteoarthritis, which is due to wear and tear, rheumatoid arthritis is systemic and can affect multiple joints. In the hip, it leads to stiffness, persistent discomfort, and structural damage. THR is often recommended when medications and physical therapy no longer provide relief.

              </h3>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                This form of arthritis results from previous injury to the hip joint — such as a fracture, dislocation, or ligament damage. The trauma disrupts joint alignment and damages cartilage, which accelerates degenerative changes. Post-traumatic arthritis may not surface immediately but often manifests years after the original injury. Patients typically report persistent pain, reduced flexibility, and instability.

              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Infective arthritis occurs when a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection invades the hip joint, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. It may occur due to bloodstream infections, surgeries, or injections around the joint. If not treated promptly, it can destroy the cartilage and joint surface, leaving patients with long-term stiffness and pain. In chronic or post-infective cases, hip replacement may be necessary to restore function.

                Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a condition where the hip socket is abnormally shallow, making it difficult for the femoral head to stay in place. It is usually diagnosed in infancy but may remain unnoticed until adulthood when it presents as pain or limited movement. Dysplasia leads to early-onset arthritis due to joint instability. Surgical correction, including hip replacement, is often required in adults with advanced dysplasia-related degeneration.

                  A complete <strong>clinical assessment</strong>, along with <strong>X-rays or MRI</strong>, helps confirm the extent of joint damage and decide the implant type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or anemia will be addressed and optimized to minimize surgical risk.

                <li>
                  You&apos;ll meet the <strong>anesthetist</strong> to decide between spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia based on your medical profile.

                <li>
                  We recommend <strong>prehabilitation exercises</strong>, which are specific routines aimed at strengthening the muscles around your hip before surgery. This often results in quicker post-op recovery and better mobility.

              A successful <strong>Total Hip Replacement</strong> is more than just a surgical procedure — it's often a turning point in a person's life. Whether you're suffering from osteoarthritis, AVN, or injury-related hip damage, the surgery can significantly enhance your physical function, mental well-being, and quality of life.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              At <strong>Sports Orthopedics Bangalore</strong>, Dr. Naveen Kumar has helped hundreds of patients walk pain-free again and reclaim their independence. Here's how:

              </h3>
              <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                One of the biggest benefits of hip replacement surgery is <strong>complete relief from chronic pain</strong>. Whether your pain is localized to the hip, groin, or radiates to the knee, replacing the damaged joint with a smooth-functioning implant eliminates the root cause of the discomfort.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Patients who struggled for years with pain while walking, sitting, or sleeping often describe the transformation as "instant relief."

              <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                Stiff hips limit your movement and affect your balance. After a hip replacement, patients often regain their ability to walk, bend, climb stairs, and even sit cross-legged — activities that were once impossible. Improved hip alignment also corrects posture issues and can reduce the need for walking aids over time.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
                If you're based in <strong>Bangalore</strong> and have been relying on a stick or walker due to stiffness or instability, hip replacement can help you walk confidently again.

                Chronic hip issues can sometimes cause a difference in leg length, which may affect gait and lead to lower back problems. During Total Hip Replacement surgery, such discrepancies are often corrected, or significantly reduced, helping restore your natural walking rhythm and symmetry.

                      Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a surgical procedure where the damaged parts of the hip joint are removed and replaced with artificial components made of metal, ceramic, or high-grade plastic. It's primarily recommended for patients suffering from <strong>severe hip arthritis</strong>, <strong>Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</strong>, or <strong>rheumatoid arthritis</strong> when pain and stiffness interfere with daily life.

                      Yes, the goal of hip replacement is to <strong>restore pain-free movement</strong> and help you return to your routine. Activities like walking, driving, sitting cross-legged, and light exercises are typically resumed gradually over 2–3 months. High-impact sports should be avoided unless cleared by your surgeon.

                      Modern hip implants typically last <strong>15 to 20 years</strong> or more, depending on your activity levels, weight, and health. Many patients live the rest of their lives without needing another surgery. However, if the implant loosens or wears out (known as implant failure), a <strong>revision hip replacement</strong> may be needed.
