              What Is Avascular Necrosis?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a condition where bone tissue dies because of a lack of blood supply. This can lead to the bone breaking down and eventually collapsing. It often affects weight-bearing joints like the hips, knees, and shoulders.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              The main cause of AVN is reduced blood flow to the bone. Without enough blood, the bone cells die, and the bone structure weakens. Over time, this can cause joint pain and limit movement. For those seeking detailed insights into AVN, including early diagnosis and treatment options, our <Link href="/bone-joint-school/avn-hip/" className="font-medium hover:underline" style={{ color: brandColors.accent }}>AVN Hip Treatment page</Link> provides comprehensive information.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              Several risk factors contribute to AVN. Trauma, such as fractures or dislocations, can damage blood vessels that supply the bone. Long-term use of high-dose steroids, often prescribed for conditions like asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, is another risk factor. Excessive alcohol consumption can also interfere with blood flow and lead to AVN.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              Certain demographics are more at risk. Middle-aged individuals, particularly those with underlying health conditions like lupus or diabetes, are more susceptible. Men are more commonly affected than women. Lifestyle factors, such as obesity and smoking, increase the risk too.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              Understanding these causes and risk factors is crucial. Recognizing early symptoms can lead to prompt diagnosis and effective management. By addressing these risks, individuals can take proactive steps to maintain joint health and prevent further complications.

              Avascular necrosis (AVN) can be sneaky. It often starts quietly, but the symptoms become more noticeable as it progresses. Here's what to watch for at each stage.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 sm:mb-8 space-y-2 sm:space-y-3 text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              <li>
                <strong>Stage 1:</strong> You might not feel anything unusual at first. There are no obvious symptoms, but changes are happening inside your bones. It's the calm before the storm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stage 2:</strong> Mild pain starts to creep in, usually when you&apos;re active. You might notice a bit of stiffness, especially after a long day. The pain isn&apos;t constant, but it&apos;s enough to catch your attention.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stage 3:</strong> Pain becomes a regular visitor. It can show up even when you're resting, not just when you're on the move. You might feel it more when you put weight on the affected joint. It can radiate to nearby areas like the groin, thigh, or buttock.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stage 4:</strong> The pain is severe and hard to ignore. It can be constant, and the joint might feel like it&apos;s giving way. At this point, joint collapse is a real possibility.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>

              Avascular necrosis (AVN) requires a precise approach to treatment, tailored to its stage and the patient&apos;s needs. We offer a variety of options, starting with nonsurgical treatments that aim to manage symptoms and slow progression.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              For early stages, physical therapy is often recommended. It helps maintain joint mobility and strength. Medications like NSAIDs can also reduce pain and inflammation. Osteoporosis drugs may be prescribed to support bone health.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              But if AVN progresses, surgical interventions might be necessary. One option is <strong>core decompression</strong>: This involves removing a portion of the inner bone to reduce pressure and improve blood flow. Another possibility is <Link href="/procedure-surgery/stem-cell-therapy/" className="font-medium hover:underline" style={{ color: brandColors.accent }}>stem cell therapy</Link>, which promotes healing and regeneration of the affected bone tissue by utilizing regenerative treatment techniques.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              In advanced cases, where the joint is severely compromised, a <strong>joint replacement</strong> might be the best course. This involves replacing the damaged joint with an artificial one, often restoring mobility and reducing pain significantly.
            </p>

                  question: "Is Avascular Necrosis reversible?",
                  answer: "AVN rarely reverses. Early detection and treatment can slow its progress and maintain joint function. Medications, core decompression, and stem cell therapy help manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Complete reversal is uncommon."
                },
                {
                  question: "Can AVN be prevented?",
                  answer: "While not all cases of AVN can be prevented, managing risk factors can reduce the likelihood. This includes limiting alcohol intake, using corticosteroids cautiously under medical supervision, avoiding trauma to the bones where possible, and managing underlying medical conditions that can affect blood flow."
                },
                {
                  question: "What is the recovery time after AVN surgery?",
                  answer: "Recovery time depends on the specific AVN surgery performed and your overall health. After procedures like core decompression or stem cell therapy, a gradual return to activities is expected over several months. A total joint replacement, if needed, typically requires a few months of rehabilitation to regain mobility and strength. Your surgeon will provide a personalized recovery plan."
