              In a robotic knee replacement, the surgeon remains in full control, but the <strong>robotic system</strong> provides real-time guidance and feedback. Think of it as a high-tech assistant: it helps Dr. Naveen plan the surgery tailored to your knee's unique anatomy and ensures that the implant is positioned with pinpoint precision. Whether you need a <strong>robotic total knee replacement</strong> (replacing the entire knee joint) or a <strong>robotic partial knee replacement</strong> (replacing only the damaged part of the knee), this technology allows for an incredibly accurate procedure. Importantly, knee replacement is one of the most effective surgeries for relieving pain and restoring mobility. Robotic assistance takes this proven procedure to the next level by improving surgical accuracy and consistency for even better results. In the sections below, we explain when robotic knee replacement is needed, its benefits, what the surgery involves, the recovery process, and why <strong>Dr. Naveen Kumar</strong> is the right choice for robotic knee surgery in Bangalore.

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 sm:mb-8 space-y-3 sm:space-y-4 text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>
              <li>
                <strong>Pre-operative Planning:</strong> Before the surgery, a CT scan of your knee is taken. This scan is used to create a precise 3D virtual model of your knee. Dr. Naveen uses this model with the robotic software to plan the optimal size and position of your implant based on your specific anatomy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anesthesia and Preparation:</strong> On the day of surgery, you will receive anesthesia (general or regional, as decided with your anesthesiologist). The surgical area will be cleaned and prepared.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Robotic-Assisted Surgery:</strong> Dr. Naveen makes the incisions and uses the robotic arm to prepare the bone surfaces and implant the components. The robotic system provides real-time data and guidance, allowing for adjustments to ensure perfect alignment and balance of the ligaments around the knee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Implant Placement:</strong> The prosthetic components (femoral, tibial, and patellar, if needed) are precisely placed according to the pre-operative plan. The robotic system helps confirm the accuracy of the placement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Closure and Recovery:</strong> Once the implant is securely in place and the knee's stability and range of motion are checked, the incisions are closed. You will then be moved to a recovery room for monitoring.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg" style={{ color: brandColors.lightText }}>

                  question: "What is robotic knee replacement surgery?",
                  answer: "Robotic knee replacement surgery is an advanced procedure where a surgeon uses a robotic arm to assist in performing a knee replacement. This technology allows for greater precision in bone cuts and implant placement, potentially leading to better outcomes and faster recovery."
                },
                {
                  question: "What are the advantages of robotic knee replacement over traditional surgery?",
                  answer: "Advantages include increased precision, potentially less pain and scarring, faster recovery, and improved implant longevity due to better alignment."
                },
                {
                  question: "Who is a good candidate for robotic knee replacement?",
                  answer: "Candidates are typically those with severe knee arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis) or significant knee joint damage that hasn't responded to conservative treatments. A thorough evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon is necessary."
                },
                {
                  question: "How long does it take to recover from a robotic knee replacement?",
                  answer: "Recovery varies, but many patients experience a quicker initial recovery compared to traditional methods. Full recovery and return to all activities can take several months and depends on adherence to physical therapy."
                },
                {
                  question: "Is robotic knee replacement surgery safe?",
                  answer: "Yes, it is considered safe. The robotic system enhances the surgeon's ability to perform the procedure accurately, which can contribute to overall safety and reduce certain risks. As with any surgery, there are potential risks that your surgeon will discuss with you."
                },
                {
                  question: "What is the cost of robotic knee replacement surgery in Bangalore?",
                  answer: "The cost can vary based on the hospital, type of implant, and specific patient needs. It's best to consult with Dr. Naveen Kumar's office for a detailed cost estimate. While it might be slightly higher upfront, the potential for better outcomes and quicker recovery can offer long-term value."
