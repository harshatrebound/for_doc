    subtitle: "Understanding the Knee Anatomy",
    paragraphs: [
      "Your knee is more than just a hinge. It's a powerful and intricate structure, built to withstand your body's weight while enabling movement like walking, jumping, and pivoting. Think of it as a complex machine made up of bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage—each part crucial for smooth motion.",
      "The knee consists of three main bones: the femur (thighbone), tibia (shinbone), and patella (kneecap). Supporting these bones are vital ligaments—the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) being one of the most important. It controls forward motion and rotational stability. The meniscus, on the other hand, acts as the knee's shock absorber. It's a C-shaped piece of cartilage that cushions the bones and evenly distributes body weight.",
      "Without a healthy ACL and meniscus, your knee becomes unstable, painful, and at risk for long-term damage. That's why understanding these structures is key—especially if you're facing an injury and considering reconstruction or repair.",

    subtitle: "What Are ACL and Meniscus Injuries?",
    paragraphs: [
      "ACL and meniscus injuries often go hand in hand, especially among athletes. The ACL is susceptible to tearing when a sudden change in direction, landing improperly from a jump, or direct impact occurs. Similarly, the meniscus can tear when twisted while bearing weight.",
      "An ACL tear is a complete or partial disruption of the ligament that leads to joint instability. Meanwhile, a meniscus tear can vary in severity—from minor fraying to a large tear that causes the knee to lock or give way. Both injuries not only limit movement but can also lead to chronic issues if left untreated.",
      "Together, an ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair procedure aim to restore knee stability, function, and durability. Whether you're a weekend warrior or a professional athlete, this surgery can be life-changing.",

    additionalParagraphs: [
      "Interestingly, women are more prone to ACL injuries than men, largely due to differences in anatomy, hormones, and muscle control. Also, inadequate warm-ups, weak core muscles, and poor technique during high-intensity workouts or sports can increase your chances of injury.",

Regardless of how it happens, a torn meniscus can severely limit your knee's range of motion and comfort.",

    question: "Will I be able to play sports again after ACL reconstruction?",
    answer: [
      "Yes, the primary goal of ACL reconstruction is to enable patients to return to their pre-injury activity levels, including sports. Success rates are high, but it depends on diligent rehab, the type of sport, and individual factors. Most athletes return to sports within 9-12 months.",

  {
    id: "faq3",
    question: "Is ACL surgery painful?",
    answer: [
      "You will experience post-operative pain, but it is managed with medications, ice, and elevation. The acute pain typically subsides within the first week or two. Pain during rehabilitation is usually manageable and related to muscle soreness from exercises.",

    question: "What type of graft is best for ACL reconstruction?",
    answer: [
      "There's no single \"best\" graft for everyone. Common options include hamstring tendon, patellar tendon (both autografts from your own body), or an allograft (donor tissue). The choice depends on your age, activity level, surgeon's preference, and specific injury. Dr. Naveen Kumar will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you.",

    question: "Can a torn meniscus heal on its own?",
    answer: [
      "Some small tears in the outer part of the meniscus (the \"red zone\" with good blood supply) may heal on their own or with conservative treatment. However, larger or more complex tears, especially in the inner \"white zone\" (poor blood supply), often require surgical repair or trimming.",

  {
    id: "faq6",
    question: "When can I start walking after ACL and meniscus surgery?",
    answer: [
      "This varies. You'll likely use crutches for a few weeks. Partial weight-bearing might start soon after surgery, progressing to full weight-bearing as tolerated and as guided by your surgeon and physical therapist. For meniscus repairs, weight-bearing restrictions might be stricter to protect the repair.",

    question: "What are the success rates for ACL reconstruction?",
    answer: [
      "Success rates for ACL reconstruction are generally very high, often reported in the range of 85-95% in terms of restoring knee stability and patient satisfaction. Graft re-tear rates are relatively low but can be influenced by adherence to rehab and activity levels.",

    question: "How do I prepare for ACL surgery?",
    answer: [
      "Pre-operative preparation (\"pre-hab\") is important. This may include exercises to reduce swelling, improve range of motion, and strengthen the muscles around the knee. You'll also need to arrange for time off work/school and post-operative support at home.",

    question: "What is the difference between meniscus repair and meniscectomy?",
    answer: [
      "Meniscus repair involves suturing the torn pieces of the meniscus back together to allow them to heal. A meniscectomy involves removing the damaged portion of the meniscus. Repair is generally preferred when possible, as it preserves the meniscus and its cushioning function, potentially reducing the long-term risk of arthritis.",

    question: "Is physiotherapy necessary after surgery?",
    answer: [
      "Absolutely. Physiotherapy is a critical component of recovery after ACL and meniscus surgery. A structured, progressive rehabilitation program is essential to regain range of motion, strength, balance, and eventually return to full activity safely.",
