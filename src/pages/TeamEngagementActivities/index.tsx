                Having fun together is the well-demonstrated way to convert the strength of the Individuals into an asset of a team. Winning in the workplace is the key tool to winning in the market place. There are very powerful and fun <Link to="/team-engagement-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">employee engagement activities</Link> help in achieving strong teams and success. Trebound has built a treasure of various fun activities for employee engagement. Such fun <Link to="/team-engagement-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">employee engagement activities</Link> help in improving the morale of the teams in higher percentages than any other motivational actions taken by the organisations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Jack Welch, the renowned Management Guru and well-known as a CEO of GE classifies 'Employee Engagement' as the first among three measurement techniques for the overall performance of the organization. He says, "There are only three measurements that tell you nearly everything you need to know about your organization's overall performance: employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and cash flow." He is placing 'Team Engagement' before customer satisfaction and a cash flow.'
              </p>

              <p>
                If we observe keenly, many organizations fail because they fail to focus on the employee well-being and team engagement. The companies put customer and revenue before employees. Unless the organisations plan for <Link to="/team-engagement-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">games for employees engagement</Link> periodically, it will reflect negatively in their productivity. When we insist on conducting games frequently, the companies need not go out every time which can make a big hole in the budget. There are numerous fun and powerful <Link to="/indoor-team-building-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">indoor employee engagement games</Link> that can be organised to develop highly motivated teams.

              <p>
                Especially in the current technology dominating business scenario, the amount of importance given to improving the 'technical skills' of the team is much higher than the other 'survival' and 'success' skill. The team should be taught and trained in the below key attributes as well. Trebound can conduct various <Link to="/team-engagement-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">employee engagement activities</Link> to instill such business and survival skills.

                Why don't Team Engagement Activities result positively as aimed?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Unfortunately, organising the employee engagement activities and games are considered as a responsibility of 'HR Function' in many organizations. It is not entirely appropriate. Unless, the engagement games for employees are designed in collaboration with the HR, project teams, achieving the results as aimed would be highly challenging. It requires brainstorming sessions, discussing various issues, analysing team effectiveness, defining the requirements, identifying the gaps between Employees engagement and productivity issues followed by the well-designed Employee Engagement activities.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#313131] mt-12 mb-6">
                The emotional intelligence of the organizers is the key here
              </h2>

              <p>
                The author of 'Employee Engagement 2.0, Kevin Kruse insists the fact, "Employee engagement advocates the emotional commitment of the employees towards the organization and its goals."
              </p>

              <p>
                To advocate such emotional commitment, the professionals who organise the team games must have astonishing emotional intelligence. What does it take to build the best employee engagement activity? The process should start with asking 'why'.
              </p>

              <p>
                'Why' are we conducting the Team Engagement activities now? What is the key goal behind the initiative? The answer will set the goal or a vision. Once the vision is set, then comes the teams. Teams need to be given utmost priority while building any team games.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#313131] mt-12 mb-6">
                Think and Treat Teams as 'human beings' first before planning Your Team Engagement Activities
              </h2>

              <p>
                Foremost among all, one fact needs to be remembered again and again. Whatever position they are in and the years of experience they have gained as professionals, the employees are first 'normal' human beings with 'normal' feelings, emotions and needs. Often, teams are considered as 'mere professionals' with 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' skills, the emotional part is ignored completely. The organizers need to understand the emotional needs of the teams.
