            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The <strong>'Corporate Team Outbound Training'</strong> plays an integral part in advocating the organizational culture among employees. In fact, the team outings provide the best opportunity to identify and bring out the educators, facilitators, quick learners and leaders from your teams. Everyone boasts about building high performing teams in organizations. How can we define a team as a strong one? The high performing team is a group of professionals work under a shared vision, collaborate effectively, utilize the resources optimally, communicate excellently to achieve the goal set. When the team becomes stronger, the responsibilities are handled with clear understanding and in a matured way. Such maturity aids in mitigating the risks associated with the business and helps to accomplish the objectives and so the organizational vision.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Let us look at what happens when the communication is strategized well among teams during outbound training. The facilitator understands the goals, about the teams, strengths & weaknesses of the individuals in a team and the processes involved in various communication modes. Moreover, the team also understands the risks associated with the whole set-up. There are brainstorming sessions normally help in making and executing such plans in the corporate environment. However, compared to in-room sessions, it is proved that the fun and playful way of training sessions have shown greater results all through these years. Trebound team with extensive experience managing teams, organising <Link to="/corporate-team-outing" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">team outings</Link>, greatly supports corporates to build strong teams through their well thought out <Link to="/corporate-team-building-activities" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">group activities</Link> and <Link to="/team-building-games" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">team building games</Link>. What happens when the teams undergo fun based experiential training sessions. Firstly, the teams feel relaxed and comfortable which ultimately elevates their listening and thinking capability. The observations stay for an extended period in mind so that the teams apply as and when the right situation arises.

            <h3 className="text-[#FF4C39] mb-8 font-bold text-2xl">The impact of <strong>Experiential Learning</strong> in team work environment</h3>
            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Whatever be the experience level of the attendees or the size of the groups, the experiential learning method creates wonders in corporate training sessions. As quoted by David Kolb, the Guru of Experiential Learning Method, "Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience", Trebound team focuses on building skills in the trainees by transforming the experience into effective learning. The outbound training games are designed based on various skill requirements and after serious brain-storming sessions.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-[#FF4C39] mb-8 font-bold text-2xl">Through the Experiential Learning model, Trebound team helps the organizations to benefit as below:</h3>

              <li className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600">Advocates the new perspective among teams through a carefully built activity that becomes the reinterpretation of earlier experience.</li>
              <li className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600">Aids the teams to reflect what they observe by identifying the gaps between the perceptions and experience.</li>
              <li className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600">Encourages the teams to come up with fresher ideas to implement the new learning's and experiences in the forecasted scenarios.</li>

            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">

            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Even though the corporate teams aim at having fun during team outbound sessions, the main goal is to achieve the vision established. Trebound team, by collaborating with the organizations, understand the common goal set and design the activities after a careful brainstorming to heighten the effectiveness. Apart from the power point based training sessions, the team also uses <strong>Role Plays</strong> to make the teams understand various concepts. The role plays provide the groups a co-operative experience. Every role that the team plays comes with different set of challenges where practicing the learning's in form of various activities support them to mitigate those challenges.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-[#FF4C39] pl-6 italic text-gray-700 my-8 text-lg">
              "Practice is the hardest part of learning, and the training is the essence of transformation"
            </blockquote>
            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The role plays are used to provide the first level of understanding where the trainees get an opportunity to understand the concept by experiencing the same through different scenarios. Moreover, the role plays bring in a lot of entertainment factors, and, at the same time, encourages the team to learn how to observe the views of the opponents. The self-awareness and 'being sensitive to others perspective' are two key skills which can be indulged efficiently through role-plays.

            <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The case studies help in exploring various behaviours, thought processes and experiences in-depth so that the teams learn to implement the concepts in the real-time work environment.

              The case studies are the best sources to learn the fundamentals and rapidly implement the learning's in the real time Industry environment. The facts & figures, trends and the process flows one could absorb through case studies make the learning more authentic and so the professionals build an ability to be pro-active than re-active. Such proactive approach helps the individuals to acknowledge the risks and mistakes immediately and so the corrective actions are taken appropriately. Those individuals become accountable for the actions, reactions, and, most importantly, do not wait for an opportunity to knock at the door to get into essential action.

              The group activities play a major role in relieving the stress the teams go through day in and day out. While participating in any group activity, the teams benefit by releasing all the stress & anxiety the job might bring in and feel 'inclusive'. The feeling of 'inclusion' aids in triggering the 'curiosity' in people. Such curiosity takes them out of their comfort zone, the teams get to try, explore and question right to get the appropriate answers. The teams build trust among themselves. '<Link to="/trust-walk-team-building-activity" className="text-[#FF4C39] hover:text-[#FF6B5C]">Trust walk</Link>' is one activity being conducted by Trebound team, specifically to install this 'Trust' factor among teams.
