It labrum provides depth to the socket and also provides the attachment to the long head of the biceps tendon as it takes origin from the upper (Superior) portion of the socket. The biceps tendon stretches over the arm bone (head of the humerus) and acts as a pulley. As it has a long excursion, its origin at the labrum is prone to injuries.

The biceps tendon stretches over the arm bone (head of the humerus) and acts as a pulley. As it has a long excursion, its origin at the labrum is prone to injuries. When the tear of Superior portion of the labrum occurs from front to back it is called “Anterior to Posterior” tear.\n\nWhy & how does it happen?\n\nSLAP tear is seen more often in players who are into racket sports. SLAP tear can also occur as an acute injury due to fall on outstretched hand or rapid forceful stretch upwards. It can also happen due to wear and tear.\n\nWho gets this injury?\n\nWe see this in 2 different age groups. It was typically seen in sporting population such as tennis and badminton players, basketball players, cricketers and so on. Typical age group is 20 to 45 years.\n\nSymptoms\n\nClicking, locking, popping sound and sensation\n\nPain on lifting the arm sideways\n\nFeeling of instability or shoulder popping out\n\nFeeling of dead arm or decrease in throwing velocity\n\nPain often felt in the front of the shoulder area\n\nWhen to seek medical help?\n\nPersistent pain, locking, clicking or sense of instability warrants medical attention. Initial assessment, an x-ray and pain relieving medicines form first line of management. Further assessment by an expert Arthroscopy Surgeon and MRI scan are necessary to analyze the extent of injury / tear.\n\nWhat happens to the SLAP tear if no treatment is undertaken?\n\nSLAP tear cannot heal naturally as the joint fluid bathes it and doesn’t allow its edges to come in contact with each other. Avoiding playing certain sports may reduce the pain and discomfort. However the pain may gradually worsens over a period of several months to years. This also depends of the type of SLAP Tear.\n\nWhat happens when I visit the Consultant?\n\nYou will be asked about the nature of injury, symptoms further to that so far. Consultant will examine you and discuss the treatment modalities.\n\nWhat treatment options do we have?\n\nThe treatment modalities vary from physiotherapy, activity modification to steroid injection. In patients with no respite, shoulder arthroscopy (Key-hole surgery) and SLAP Repair would be the definitive treatment to heal the SLAP tear.",

      "content_html": "<p>Book an Appointment</p>\n<p>ATFL or Anterior Talo Fibular Ligament is one of the 3 main ligaments on the outer side of the ankle joint. It is a rubbery rope that holds the 2 bones together. ATFL along with its fellow ligaments CFL and PTFL stabilses the ankle on the outer side. ATFL being in the front part of the ankle on the outer side, protects the joint against inward twisting forces particularly when the ankle is bent downwards.</p>\n<h3>Why & how does it happen?</h3>\n<p>ATFL tear are one of commonest injuries to the ankle joint. It typically happens when the ankle and foot gets twisted inwards and the body load falls on the twisted ankle. When the twisting forces overwhelm what the ATFL can manage, the CFL tear occurs. It often occurs due to missing a step on the stairs, or on the playground.</p>\n<h3>Who gets this injury?</h3>\n<p>Women are more prone to this injury. It is common not only in sporting population but also in general public. Fall from the two wheelers, bikes and cycles are another common reason for this injury.

For the ligament to heal, an average of 4 to 6 weeks is required. Upto 6 months your body will keep trying to heal this ligament.

      "content_text": "ATFL Ligament Injury – Ankle\n\nBook an Appointment\n\nOverview\n\nATFL or Anterior Talo Fibular Ligament is one of the 3 main ligaments on the outer side of the ankle joint. It is a rubbery rope that holds the 2 bones together. ATFL along with its fellow ligaments CFL and PTFL stabilses the ankle on the outer side.  ATFL being in the front part of the ankle on the outer side, protects the joint against inward twisting forces particularly when the ankle is bent downwards.\n\nWhy & how does it happen?\n\nATFL tear are one of commonest injuries to the ankle joint. It typically happens when the ankle and foot gets twisted inwards and the body load falls on the twisted ankle. When the twisting forces overwhelm what the ATFL can manage, the CFL tear occurs. It often occurs due to missing a step on the stairs, or on the playground.\n\nWho gets this injury?\n\nWomen are more prone to this injury. It is common not only in sporting population but also in general public. Fall from the two wheelers, bikes and cycles are another common reason for this injury. Typical age group is 20 to 50 years.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSudden severe ankle pain\n\nIn some loud POP sound\n\nPainful to walk\n\nFeeling that the ankle will give away and not supporting\n\nSwelling appears usually few hours later\n\nWithin a week most patients with ATFL tear will be able to walk with a slight limp\n\nPersistence of instability sensation and pain in certain movements and activities\n\nNatural History (Progression of disease in the absence of treatment)\n\nATFL has got the potential to self heal, however proper treatment is necessary. For the ligament to heal, an average of 4 to 6 weeks is required. Upto 6 months your body will keep trying to heal this ligament. After that if the laxity persists, that may remain so for rest of the life unless an intervention takes place. If the ATFL does not heal or if it heals with a stretch, then it is likely to buckle repeatedly and cause further ankle injuries. In addition, sitting cross legged continues to cause pain if ATFL has not healed well.\n\nWhen to seek medical help?\n\nInitial assessment, an x-ray and pain relieving medicines is what is needed as an immediate remedy. Further assessment by an expert Orthopedic Surgeon is useful. Most ATFL injuries do not need an MRI scan during the initial phase of treatment. ​\n\nWhat happens when I visit the Consultant?\n\nYou will be asked about the nature of injury, symptoms further to that so far. Consultant will examine you and discuss the treatment modalities.\n\nWhat are the treatment Modalities?\n\nThe treatment modalities vary from simple ankle binder to PRP Injection to Ankle Ligament Surgery depending upon the grade of tear and the chronicity.",

Shoulder is a joint with vast range of movement. This increased mobility comes with a price of the joint being prone to instability and injuries.</p>\n<p>Shoulder pain can occur with movement in particular direction or with lifting objects in a particular angle. It can also hurt during rest. The area of pain is also an important characteristic which helps in understanding which structure of the shoulder has been affected.</p>\n<p>Swelling. Swelling indicates that the shoulder is irritated. This can be due to mechanical causes such as rubbing, inflammation due to wear and tear or injury to the internal structures.</p>\n<p>Stiffness. Stiffness can be due to swelling or muscle tightness.

      "content_text": "Shoulder Pain\n\nBook an Appointment\n\nShoulder pain can affect all age groups. The reasons for the shoulder pain can range from injury, infection, instability to arthritis. Shoulder is a joint with vast range of movement. This increased mobility comes with a price of the joint being prone to instability and injuries.\n\nSymptoms\n\nShoulder pain can occur with movement in particular direction or with lifting objects in a particular angle. It can also hurt during rest. The area of pain is also an important characteristic which helps in understanding which structure of the shoulder has been affected.\n\nSwelling. Swelling indicates that the shoulder is irritated. This can be due to mechanical causes such as rubbing, inflammation due to wear and tear or injury to the internal structures.\n\nStiffness. Stiffness can be due to swelling or muscle tightness. If stiffness is not allowing to lift the arm up, it means that something is mechanically blocking the free movements of the shoulder.\n\nInstability. Instability occurs due to the labrum or lip of the socket being torn or stretches. This can be either in the form of subluxation where the joint is a bit loose or frank dislocation, where the joint is out of place and needs to be physically reduced back into place.\n\nConditions\n\nInjuries\n\nBankarts (anterior) labral tear\n\nSLAP tear\n\nKims (posterior) labral tear\n\nRotator cuff tear\n\nCartilage tear\n\nPectoralis Muscle Tear\n\nFracture around the shoulder joint (Intra-articular fractures)​\n\nWear & Tear\n\nShoulder Impingement\n\nBiceps tendinopathy\n\nSubacromial Bursitis\n\nLoose body\n\nInfection\n\nSeptic Arthritis\n\nInfective Bursitis\n\nInflammation\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\nFrozen shoulder\n\nArthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis\n\nWhen to see a Doctor ?\n\nUnable to move the shoulder full range\n\nRedness and /or swelling of the shoulder\n\nPersistent pain\n\nPrevention of shoulder pain\n\nWeight management\n\nMaintaining flexibility and elasticity of the muscles\n\nRegular exercises and stretches\n\nAvoid prolonged sitting in same posture\n\nAvoid drooping of the shoulders",
