Post injection stretches can minimize the risk of recurrence.\n\nPRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) Injection\n\nPRP Injection is a safe and effective treatment for tennis elbow. The whole procedure of drawing blood, time to centrifuge and then injection is around 40 minutes of time in the out patients. For the PRP to be effective and average of 4 to 6 weeks of time is required. In some, more than one PRP injection may be required to cure the condition completely.\n\nTennis Elbow Release Surgery\n\nIn patients with no improvement with all other conservative measures, surgery is considered. This is performed either as an open surgery or arthroscopically (Keyhole). The incision for open surgery is around 3cm long. The tendon is released and debrided (the frail tissue removed). Small puncture holes are made in the bone underneath so that there is some bleeding to that area and healthy tissue can grow to that area.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nPost-surgery, the bulky dressing is removed after 4 days. Early mobilization is allowed. Gentle passive stretches for the elbow are started as early as 2 weeks. Strengthening exercises are embarked upon after 4 weeks. One is expected to return to full activity by around 6 weeks post-surgery.",

In majority of patients this would be sufficient. If healing well this would be followed by stretching exercises to get the mobility back. In patients with poor healing or no improvement, it becomes necessary to get an MRI Scan done to assess the extent of the injury.</p>\n<h3>Partial UCL Ligament tears</h3>\n<p>In partial tears which have refused to heal with simple splinting, a PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) Injection and the ROM Brace for 4 weeks is recommended. Here PRP stimulates the healing process and the brace immobilizes so that the ligament can stand a better chance to heal.</p>\n<h3>Complete UCL Ligament tears</h3>\n<p>Complete UCL ligament tears need either the ligament repair or reconstruction. Depending upon the condition of the remaining ligament tissue, either repair of reconstruction can be done. UCL repair with fiberwire and fixation to the humerus end using suture anchor is an option if the remaining ligament tissue is in good condition. Alternatively, UCL ligament reconstruction using gracilis tendon harvested from thigh/ palmaris longus tendon harvested from the forearm of the same side is an effective way of reconstructing the UCL.

      "content_text": "UCL Ligament Surgery – Elbow\n\nBook an Appointment\n\nUCL or Ulnar Collateral Ligament injury (MCL Ligament Injury) of Elbow leads to instability and pain on the ulnar (little finger) side of the elbow. Clinical examination to assess site of pain, tenderness, stress test of the Elbow gives enough pointers to diagnose, however the extent of the tear wouldn’t be easy to decipher with examination alone.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nX-ray: X-ray is performed and is useful to rule out any bone avulsion injuries, however, ligaments are not visible on the X-ray.\n\nMRI Scan: MRI Scan is the gold standard investigation to identify the type and extent of the UCL ligament injury. In addition, it helps to assess the condition of the rest of the Elbow Joint, as associated injuries such as coronoid process of ulna fracture, LUCL injury and radial head fracture.\n\nTreatment\n\nNon-surgical Treatment\n\nThe Elbow UCL ligament injuries can be treated with a ROM Elbow Brace for 6 weeks. In majority of patients this would be sufficient. If healing well this would be followed by stretching exercises to get the mobility back. In patients with poor healing or no improvement, it becomes necessary to get an MRI Scan done to assess the extent of the injury.\n\nPartial UCL Ligament tears\n\nIn partial tears which have refused to heal with simple splinting, a PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) Injection and  the ROM Brace for 4 weeks is recommended. Here PRP stimulates the healing process and the brace immobilizes so that the ligament can stand a better chance to heal.\n\nComplete UCL Ligament tears\n\nComplete UCL ligament tears need either the ligament repair or reconstruction. Depending upon the condition of the remaining ligament tissue, either repair of reconstruction can be done. UCL repair with fiberwire and fixation to the humerus end using suture anchor is an option if the remaining ligament tissue is in good condition. Alternatively, UCL ligament reconstruction using gracilis tendon harvested from thigh/ palmaris longus tendon harvested from the forearm of the same side is an effective way of reconstructing the UCL. The tendon is fixed to the bone by using bio-suture anchors. Alternatively, fiber-tape can be used to reconstruct the ligament.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nPost-surgery, you can expect to be in a thick dressing for 4 days. In patients with ligament reconstruction physiotherapy starts early. Range of movement exercises will start after 4 days. After 4 weeks strengthening exercises for the muscles controlling the elbow are started. Full functionality of the elbow can be achieved by 3 months.",

Patient may typically need 1 to 3 injections at the intervals of 1 month each. 4 to 6 weeks post injection you will get examined clinically to reassess the effectiveness of the injection.</p>\n<h3>Internal Bracing Technique</h3>\n<p>​Internal Bracing works well for patients with thin tendon grafts to augment the graft. Although Internal bracing alone has been heavily advertised, the long term outcomes of the internal bracing alone is not established. The tendon graft harvested from oneself will get incorporated into the body as the bone inter-digitations grow into tendon graft. With internal bracing long term wear and tear is expected to make it weak and non-functional.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction Hamstring Grafts</h3>\n<p>ACL Surgery using hamstring grafts is the commonest technique used worldwide as it gives reliable outcomes and the graft donor site problems are rare. The incision size is small and the hamstring strength returns to normal within 3 months.</p>\n<h3>ACL Reconstruction BTB Graft</h3>\n<p>ACL surgery using BTB (Bone-Tendon-Bone) graft from the front of the knee is another very useful technique for reconstruction. The advantage is that the bone to bone healing takes place more quickly and in an organised fashion. However the donor site pain, tenderness, longer incision makes it less popular option, however, in some this option is preferred on an individual basis.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction Quads tendon Graft</h3>\n<p>​ACL surgery can be performed using the quads tendon above the patella (knee cap).The thick graft size makes it an attractive option, however the donor site pain and weakness remains for a longer duration in these patients.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction Peroneal tendon Graft</h3>\n<p>​Peroneal tendon is an attractive option for the ACL surgery, however, the evidence for the long term efficacy of this tendon as a graft is still being evaluated.</p>\n<h3>ACL Reconstruction Single Bundle</h3>\n<p>The single bundle technique has been in use in most premier centres across the world. If is effective and technically sound to reproduce with proper training.</p>\n<h3>ACL Reconstruction Double Bundle</h3>\n<p>ACL reconstruction with two bundles does replicate the anatomy well, however the techniue is difficult to replicate and the outcomes reported have not been uniform across the fraternity. And with 2 tunnels, revisionsurgery if needed becomes more complicated.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction – All-inside technique</h3>\n<p>​This technique is best used when the graft size is thin and getting longer graft is not possible. In this technique titanium buttons are used on both sides. The fixation with this provides secure support and avoids the problems due to liquification of the bio-composite screw.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction – Tight Rope & BioComposite Screw Fixation</h3>\n<p>​This is the commonest way of fixing the graft in ACL reconstruction where a titanium button is used on the femoral (thigh bone) side and bio-composite screw on the tibial (leg bone) side. It provides secure fixation and good outcomes.</p>\n<h3>​ACL Reconstruction – Anatomical</h3>\n<p>The femoral tunnel in the place where the ACL fibers are attached and in the same angle of pull is better as it provides better rotational stability.</p>\n<h3>ACL Reconstruction – Non-Anatomical</h3>\n<p>Some surgeons follow the trans-tibial tunnel technique to drill the femoral tunnel as well. However, this leads to poor rotational stability.</p>",

With internal bracing long term wear and tear is expected to make it weak and non-functional.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction Hamstring Grafts\n\nACL Surgery using hamstring grafts is the commonest technique used worldwide as it gives reliable outcomes and the graft donor site problems are rare.  The incision size is small and the hamstring strength returns to normal within 3 months.\n\nACL Reconstruction BTB Graft\n\nACL surgery using BTB (Bone-Tendon-Bone) graft from the front of the knee is another very useful technique for reconstruction.  The advantage is that the bone to bone healing takes place more quickly and in an organised fashion. However the donor site pain, tenderness, longer incision makes it less popular option, however, in some this option is preferred on an individual basis.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction Quads tendon Graft\n\n​ACL surgery can be performed using the quads tendon above the patella (knee cap).The thick graft size makes it an attractive option, however the donor site pain and weakness remains for a longer duration in these patients.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction Peroneal tendon Graft\n\n​Peroneal tendon is an attractive option for the ACL surgery, however, the evidence for the long term efficacy of this tendon as a graft is still being evaluated.\n\nACL Reconstruction Single Bundle\n\nThe single bundle technique has been in use in most premier centres across the world. If is effective and technically sound to reproduce with proper training.\n\nACL Reconstruction Double Bundle\n\nACL reconstruction with two bundles does replicate the anatomy well, however the techniue is difficult to replicate and the outcomes reported have not been uniform across the fraternity. And with 2 tunnels, revisionsurgery if needed becomes more complicated.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction – All-inside technique\n\n​This technique is best used when the graft size is thin and getting longer graft is not possible. In this technique titanium buttons are used on both sides. The fixation with this provides secure support and avoids the problems due to liquification of the bio-composite screw.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction – Tight Rope & BioComposite Screw Fixation\n\n​This is the commonest way of fixing the graft in ACL reconstruction where a titanium button is used on the femoral (thigh bone) side and bio-composite screw on the tibial (leg bone) side. It provides secure fixation and good outcomes.\n\n​ACL Reconstruction – Anatomical\n\nThe femoral tunnel in the place where the ACL fibers are attached and in the same angle of pull is better as it provides better rotational stability.\n\nACL Reconstruction – Non-Anatomical\n\nSome surgeons follow the trans-tibial tunnel technique to drill the femoral tunnel as well. However, this leads to poor rotational stability.",

However, majority of symptomatic tears may not heal.\n\nACL + Meniscal Injury\n\n​In patients with ACL and meniscal tear, at the time of ACL reconstruction surgery, meniscus surgery is undertaken as well to help stabilise the knee.\n\n​Meniscal Surgery\n\n​Meniscal surgery is an arthroscopic (key hole ) surgery which can by done as a day care procedure. There are various types of surgeries undertaken for the meniscus depending on the type and location of the tear.\n\nMeniscal repair\n\nMeniscal repair\n\nAll suture meniscal repair\n\nPeek meniscal repair\n\nInside out meniscal repair\n\nOutside in meniscal repair\n\nMeniscal root repair\n\nMeniscal transplantation\n\nPartial Meniscectomy (meniscal balancing) - removal of part of the meniscus which is loose and not viable.\n\nMeniscal Repair Rehabilitation\n\nPost-surgery, you are allowed to walk on the same day evening. In patients with meniscal repair, partial weight bearing on the front of the foot and use of walker or a stick is advised for upto 4 weeks. In patients with partial meniscectomy, full weight bearing on the leg is allowed within first few days as the pain settles. Physiotherapy exercises start early. In the first 6 weeks the focus is mainly on getting the full ROM and help regain the muscle strength. The whole rehabilitation process will take about 4 to 5 months before returning back to playing sports on the ground or court.",
