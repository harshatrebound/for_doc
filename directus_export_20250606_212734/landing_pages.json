      "content_html": "<p>A torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is a common knee injury that can sideline you from sports and even make everyday activities difficult. The ACL is a key knee ligament that stabilizes your knee during pivoting and sudden movements. When it’s torn (often during sports like football, basketball, or accidents), the knee can buckle or feel unstable. This not only impairs your performance but can also lead to further damage (like meniscus tears or early arthritis) if left untreated.</p>\n<p>ACL reconstruction surgery is a specialized knee ligament surgery designed to restore stability to an ACL-deficient knee. This procedure replaces the damaged ACL with a new tissue graft, effectively creating a new ligament. This surgery is often crucial for athletes and active individuals who want to return to sports and anyone experiencing knee instability in daily life. By reconstructing the ACL, patients can regain confidence in their knee, prevent recurrent injuries, and protect the joint’s long-term health.</p>\n<p>If you’re in Bangalore (Koramangala, BTM Layout, HSR Layout, or surrounding areas) and suffering from an ACL injury, know that help is available. Our sports injury specialist, Dr. Naveen, will guide you through the journey—from initial assessment to full recovery—so you can get back to the activities you love with a strong and stable knee.</p>\n<h3>Extensive Experience</h3>\n<h3>Sports Injury Specialist</h3>\n<h3>Advanced Surgical Techniques</h3>\n<h3>High Success Rates & Testimonials</h3>\n<h3>Personalized Care</h3>\n<h3>Convenient Location</h3>\n<p>ACL reconstruction is not a one-size-fits-all procedure. Dr. Naveen employs various techniques and graft types based on what’s best for each patient. Two key aspects define an ACL surgery: the graft choice (what tissue is used to create the new ligament) and the surgical technique (how the graft is placed and fixed in the knee). Below, we break down the options and advanced techniques used in ACL surgeries:</p>\n<p>Graft Options for ACL ReconstructionThe “graft” is the tissue that will become your new ACL. We will help you choose the ideal graft depending on your age, activity level, and preferences. Common ACL graft choices include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hamstring Tendon Autograft: This is one of the most popular grafts. It uses two of your own hamstring tendons (taken from the back of your thigh). Hamstring grafts allow strong ligament reconstruction with relatively small incisions. Patients often have less front-knee pain compared to other grafts, and the strength of a well-prepared hamstring graft is excellent for returning to sports.</li>\n  <li>Patellar Tendon Autograft (Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone): This technique uses the middle third of your own patellar tendon (just below the kneecap), along with small pieces of bone attached at each end. It has been a “gold standard” for athletes because the bone-to-bone healing can make the graft very secure. Patellar tendon grafts are extremely strong and have a high success rate for athletes in high-demand sports. The trade-off is that some patients might experience temporary pain in the front of the knee or discomfort when kneeling during recovery.</li>\n  <li>Quadriceps Tendon Autograft: The quadriceps tendon (above the kneecap) is another autograft option, sometimes taken with a small piece of bone. It provides a thick, robust graft—useful in patients who need a larger graft or in revision (repeat) ACL surgeries. Dr. Naveen might choose a quad tendon graft if you have had a previous ACL surgery or if your build and activity needs suggest this as a better option. Many patients tolerate this graft well with low risk of long-term pain.</li>\n  <li>Allograft (Donor Tissue): In some cases, an allograft (a tendon from a donor/cadaver) may be used. The benefit is that it avoids taking your own tissue, so your own muscles and tendons remain untouched. This can mean a shorter initial surgery and less post-operative discomfort at the harvest site. However, allografts generally take longer to fully incorporate and heal into the bone, and they might have a slightly higher failure rate in young athletic individuals. Dr. Naveen typically reserves allografts for specific situations – such as certain revision surgeries or for older, less active patients – and only uses allograft from highly screened sources to ensure safety.</li>\n  <li>Synthetic Ligament Grafts: Newer artificial ligament materials (synthetic grafts) have been developed to replace the ACL. While not common, they may be an option in select cases or clinical trials. Synthetic grafts (like the LARS ligament) can offer the advantage of immediate strength and quicker surgery, but historically some have had issues with long-term failure. Dr. Naveen will discuss if a synthetic graft is appropriate or if sticking to biological tissue is the better choice for you (in most cases, your own tissue or a donor tissue is preferred for best healing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hamstring Tendon Autograft: This is one of the most popular grafts. It uses two of your own hamstring tendons (taken from the back of your thigh). Hamstring grafts allow strong ligament reconstruction with relatively small incisions. Patients often have less front-knee pain compared to other grafts, and the strength of a well-prepared hamstring graft is excellent for returning to sports.</p>\n<p>Patellar Tendon Autograft (Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone): This technique uses the middle third of your own patellar tendon (just below the kneecap), along with small pieces of bone attached at each end.

Dr. Naveen will discuss if a synthetic graft is appropriate or if sticking to biological tissue is the better choice for you (in most cases, your own tissue or a donor tissue is preferred for best healing).</p>\n<p>Advanced Surgical TechniquesIn all ACL reconstructions performed by Sports Orthopedics, arthroscopic surgery is the standard. This means the procedure is done through small keyhole incisions using a camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments, rather than a large open incision. Arthroscopy leads to less pain, minimal scarring, and faster recovery. Within the realm of arthroscopic ACL surgery, there are a few advanced techniques and innovations that Dr. Naveen utilizes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Anatomic ACL Reconstruction: This isn’t a specific “technique” but a principle Dr. Naveen follows. It means the new ACL is placed in the exact original anatomic position of your natural ACL. By drilling tunnels in the correct anatomical spots on the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), the reconstructed ligament can restore more natural knee mechanics. This leads to better stability, especially for pivoting movements, and reduces the risk of re-injury.</li>\n  <li>All-Inside ACL Reconstruction: In a traditional ACL surgery, one end of the graft is often fixed with a screw inside the bone. In an all-inside technique, special sockets (rather than full tunnels) are created in the bones, and the graft is anchored with small, strong buttons on both the femur and tibia. The all-inside approach uses even smaller bone openings and can preserve more bone stock. It often results in less post-op pain at the bone sites and can allow the surgeon to double-loop the hamstring graft to make it thicker. Dr. Naveen may use the all-inside method to maximize graft strength while minimizing tissue trauma, depending on the case.</li>\n  <li>Double-Bundle ACL Reconstruction: The ACL has two functional bundles of fibers (anteromedial and posterolateral). In certain patients (like high-level athletes or if anatomy calls for it), Dr. Naveen can perform a double-bundle ACL reconstruction, which uses two separate smaller grafts to recreate both bundles of the ACL. The goal is to mimic the knee’s natural anatomy more closely, potentially giving improved rotational stability. This is a more complex technique and not necessary for every patient, but Dr. Naveen is experienced in it for cases that warrant a double-bundle approach.</li>\n  <li>Internal Brace Augmentation: For additional support, especially in high-demand athletes or in repair of certain acute ACL tears, Dr. Naveen may use an internal brace. The internal brace is a strong synthetic fiber tape that is implanted alongside the new ACL graft. Think of it as a reinforcement – it helps protect and stabilize the healing graft during the first few critical months. Important: The internal brace is not a replacement for the actual graft; it’s an augmentation to provide extra stability while your tissue heals and strengthens. This technique can potentially allow for a more confident early rehabilitation. Dr. Naveen will consider using an internal brace if it can benefit your recovery (for example, if your ligament tissue quality allows for a partial repair with augmentation, or if you are eager to safely accelerate your rehab).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anatomic ACL Reconstruction: This isn’t a specific “technique” but a principle Dr. Naveen follows.

Rest assured, he is proficient in all the modern ACL reconstruction techniques and will customize the procedure to what best fits your knee condition and lifestyle. Whether it’s choosing the right graft or employing the latest surgical method, the goal is to ensure you have a stable knee that heals well and serves you in the long run.</p>\n<p>Facing surgery can be intimidating, but knowing what to expect can help ease your mind. At our Bangalore clinic, we believe in guiding you through every step of the process – before, during, and after your ACL reconstruction – so you feel comfortable and prepared.</p>\n<h3>Before Surgery (Preparation and Prehab)</h3>\n<p>Thorough Evaluation: First, Dr. Naveen will perform a detailed evaluation of your knee. This includes a physical examination and usually an MRI scan to confirm the ACL tear and check for any other injuries (such as meniscus or cartilage damage) that might need attention during surgery. You’ll discuss your medical history, activity goals, and any concerns.</p>\n<p>Prehabilitation (“Prehab”): If time allows (for example, if your injury is not extremely recent or if swelling needs to subside), you may be advised to do some prehab exercises with a physiotherapist before surgery. Prehab focuses on gently restoring your knee’s range of motion and strengthening the muscles (especially quadriceps and hamstrings). Going into surgery with a knee that can straighten and bend reasonably well, and with good muscle tone, can actually improve your post-surgery recovery speed. Don’t worry if your knee still feels unstable – you’ll typically wear a brace or be cautious to avoid buckling it during this period.</p>\n<p>Preparation and Planning: Dr. Naveen will explain the surgical plan, including the likely graft choice and technique tailored for you. This is a great time to ask any questions about the procedure. You’ll also get instructions for the day of surgery, such as fasting (not eating) for a certain period before the procedure, arranging for someone to drive you home, and preparing your home for post-op comfort (for example, getting ice packs, setting up a rest area, etc.). Our team will make sure all necessary blood tests and medical clearances (like fitness for anesthesia) are done prior to your surgery date.</p>\n<h3>During Surgery (The Procedure Day)</h3>\n<p>Admission and Anesthesia: On the day of surgery, you’ll be admitted to the hospital or day-surgery center. ACL reconstruction is typically done under regional (spinal) anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia – meaning you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will discuss the best option for you. Many patients receive a spinal anesthesia (numbing from the waist down) combined with light sleep sedation, so you stay comfortable and pain-free.</p>\n<p>Arthroscopic Procedure: Dr. Naveen performs the ACL reconstruction arthroscopically. Through 2-3 tiny incisions around your knee, a small camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments are inserted. First, any additional injuries are addressed – for example, trimming or stitching a torn meniscus if needed. Then, the remnants of the torn ACL are cleared out.</p>\n<p>Graft Harvest and Placement: If using an autograft (your tissue), the graft will be harvested through a small incision (for example, a short cut over the upper shin for a hamstring graft, or over the knee for a patellar graft). This incision is kept as small as possible. The graft is prepared to the correct length and thickness. Next, Dr. Naveen will drill precise tunnels or sockets in your thigh and shin bones at the anatomic ACL attachment sites. The prepared graft is then passed through the knee and fixed securely into these bone tunnels – usually with devices like strong absorbable screws or suspensory buttons. (In an all-inside technique, as mentioned earlier, the fixation might be done entirely with buttons on both ends.) Dr. Naveen ensures the graft is properly tensioned (tight but not over-tight) and that your knee has full range of motion without impingement of the graft.</p>\n<p>Duration and Wake Up: The surgery typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, though it can vary depending on complexity (for example, if we also repair other ligaments or a meniscus, it could be a bit longer). After the procedure, you’ll be moved to a recovery room as the anesthesia wears off. Don’t be surprised if you wake up with a padded bandage on your knee and maybe a brace; this is normal. Our team will monitor you until you’re fully awake and comfortable.</p>\n<p>Same-Day Discharge: ACL reconstruction is often a day-care surgery, meaning many patients go home the same day once they recover from anesthesia. In some cases, an overnight stay might be recommended (especially if surgery is done late in the day or if additional procedures were performed). Either way, you won’t be in the hospital for long.</p>\n<h3>After Surgery (Recovery and Rehabilitation)</h3>\n<p>Immediate Post-Op: When you go home, your knee will be wrapped and possibly in a knee brace locked in a straight position (depending on Dr. Naveen’s instructions and whether any other repairs were done). You’ll likely be given crutches or a walker for support. Pain is managed with medications – expect some soreness, but many patients find it’s less than they anticipated thanks to modern arthroscopic techniques and pain control methods. We’ll advise you on icing the knee regularly to keep swelling down.</p>\n<p>Weight-Bearing and Mobility: Surprisingly, you will be encouraged to start moving the same day or next day. In many cases, if only the ACL was reconstructed and the knee is stable, you can start walking with support almost immediately (typically with crutches or a walker for balance). Dr. Naveen often allows partial to full weight-bearing as tolerated right after surgery, especially if no other structures (like meniscus) need protection. For the first week, you’ll use support and avoid long periods on your feet, but basic walking around the house is encouraged. By the end of the first week, many patients can put more weight on the leg and may even begin walking short distances without support (if advised by the doctor or physio). Everyone is a bit different, so follow the specific guidance given to you.</p>\n<p>Follow-Up and Physiotherapy: You’ll have a follow-up appointment within a week or two after surgery. Stitches (if any external ones) will be removed around 10-14 days. The physiotherapy (rehab) program starts almost immediately in the first week. Initially, the focus is on gentle exercises to regain knee range of motion (especially achieving full straightening and gradual bending) and to prevent muscle stiffness. A physiotherapist will teach you exercises and monitor your progress. Strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstrings begin in a controlled way. By 4-6 weeks, the goal is usually to have near-normal walking without aids, full extension and a good bend in the knee, and improving muscle strength.</p>\n<h3>Weeks 0-6: Protective phase</h3>\n<h3>3 to 6 Months: Advanced training</h3>\n<h3>Weeks 6-12: Strength and balance phase</h3>\n<h3>6 to 9 Months: Return to sport</h3>\n<p>Rohit K Koramangala, Bangalore</p>\n<p>Koramangala, Bangalore</p>\n<p>Priya M HSR Layout, Bangalore</p>\n<p>HSR Layout, Bangalore</p>\n<p>Anil S Electronic City, Bangalore</p>\n<p>Electronic City, Bangalore</p>\n<p>How do I know if I have torn my ACL?</p>\n<p>A torn ACL often happens with a sudden twisting injury to the knee – for example, landing from a jump and twisting, or a quick change of direction while running. Patients often report hearing or feeling a “pop” in the knee at the moment of injury. Other common symptoms include immediate swelling of the knee (within the first few hours), pain (especially deep inside the knee), and a feeling of instability or “giving way” when you try to put weight on that leg. However, not all ACL tears cause severe pain after the initial injury – some people just notice the instability later when they return to activity.</p>\n<p>If you suspect an ACL tear, it’s important to see a doctor. Dr. Naveen will perform specific clinical tests on your knee (like the Lachman test or pivot shift test) to check the ACL. An MRI scan is usually ordered to confirm the diagnosis, as it can visualize the ACL and also reveal any other injuries (like meniscus tears or bone bruises) that might have occurred with the ACL tear. In summary, if your knee swelled up after an injury and now feels wobbly or unreliable, you should get it evaluated for a possible ACL tear.</p>\n<p>Does a torn ACL always require surgery?</p>\n<p>Not always – it depends on your lifestyle and the degree of instability. An ACL tear will not heal on its own (since the ligament ends retract and there’s poor blood supply), but not everyone needs surgery. If you are a very sedentary person or willing to give up pivoting sports, and if your knee feels generally stable in straight-line activities, you might manage without surgery. The treatment in such cases is focused on physiotherapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles (especially quads and hamstrings) to compensate for the missing ACL, and possibly wearing a brace during high-risk activities. Some people can cope with an ACL-deficient knee for everyday life, especially older individuals or those with very low activity demands.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re young or active, or if you experience your knee “giving way” even during simple tasks, surgery is often strongly recommended. Repeated instability episodes can cause further damage like cartilage wear or meniscus tears. For anyone who wants to return to sports, running, or an active lifestyle, an ACL reconstruction is usually the best solution to restore full stability. Dr. Naveen will assess your knee and discuss your activity goals – if you aim to get back to a sport or high-demand activities, he will likely advise that reconstruction surgery is the safest route to protect your knee long-term.</p>\n<p>Who should consider ACL reconstruction surgery?</p>\n<p>You should consider ACL reconstruction if you have a torn ACL and any of the following apply to you:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You are an athlete or recreational sportsperson who wants to return to sports that involve cutting, jumping, or quick direction changes (e.g., football, basketball, tennis, badminton, etc.).</li>\n  <li>Your knee feels unstable or gives way during everyday activities (going down stairs, stepping off a curb, turning while walking). Even if you’re not an athlete, instability in daily life is problematic and can risk further injury.</li>\n  <li>You have additional injuries (like a meniscus tear) that were treated, but the knee might still be unstable without an ACL.</li>\n  <li>You are relatively young or otherwise active and wish to maintain an active lifestyle without restricting yourself due to fear of the knee giving out.</li>\n  <li>You’ve tried conservative management (therapy, bracing) for a while and still have instability or lack of confidence in your knee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are an athlete or recreational sportsperson who wants to return to sports that involve cutting, jumping, or quick direction changes (e.g., football, basketball, tennis, badminton, etc.).</p>\n<p>Your knee feels unstable or gives way during everyday activities (going down stairs, stepping off a curb, turning while walking).

Ultimately, the decision is personalized. Dr. Naveen will help you weigh the pros and cons based on your situation. His goal is to ensure that if you do undergo ACL reconstruction, you truly need it and will benefit from it.</p>\n<p>What happens if I don’t get ACL surgery for a torn ACL?</p>\n<p>If you choose not to have surgery and you have an ACL tear, the main concern is ongoing knee instability. Without the ACL, your knee may continue to give way at unpredictable times, especially with any sudden turns or awkward steps. This is not just a functional problem; it can lead to further damage inside the knee. Every time the knee buckles, there’s a risk of secondary injuries like tearing the meniscus (the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee) or damaging the articular cartilage (which can eventually lead to arthritis). In fact, many chronic ACL-deficient knees develop meniscus tears over time due to the repeated stress and sliding in the joint.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you might have to significantly modify your activities. Sports that involve pivoting or jumping would likely be off-limits. Even hiking on uneven terrain or dancing can become risky. Some people adapt by giving up these activities or by wearing a stabilizing brace during them, but it’s a compromise.</p>\n<p>That said, if your knee is mostly stable in straight-line activities and you are disciplined about avoiding high-risk movements, you might do okay without an ACL. You would need to maintain strong leg muscles through exercise to help compensate for the lost ligament. Regular check-ups would be wise to monitor knee health. Dr. Naveen may recommend a structured rehab and a trial of non-surgical management to see if you can cope. If it becomes clear that instability is affecting your quality of life, you can always decide to proceed with surgery later. Keep in mind, though, if too much time passes with ongoing instability, any new damage (like a large meniscus tear) could make the eventual surgery and recovery more complex.</p>\n<p>How is ACL reconstruction surgery performed?</p>\n<p>ACL reconstruction is performed arthroscopically (through small incisions using a camera). The general steps are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Arthroscopic Evaluation: After you’re under anesthesia, Dr. Naveen makes two or three tiny incisions around the knee. Saline fluid is used to expand the knee joint, and a fiber-optic camera is inserted so the inside of your knee can be seen on a monitor. He will inspect all structures in the knee joint – ACL (confirm it’s torn), PCL, both menisci, cartilage surfaces, etc. Any loose fragments from the torn ACL are removed.</li>\n  <li>Address Additional Injuries: If there are any co-injuries (for example, a torn meniscus or a cartilage flap), those are addressed first. A meniscus tear might be trimmed (meniscectomy) or stitched (meniscus repair) depending on its type and location. This ensures the knee is “cleaned up” and ready for the new ACL.</li>\n  <li>Graft Harvest: If an autograft is being used (like your hamstring or patellar tendon), a small incision is made to obtain that graft. For a hamstring graft, two small tendons are carefully detached from the hamstring muscle and pulled out; they are then cleaned and bundled to form a strong new “ligament”. For a patellar tendon graft, a strip of tendon with small bone blocks is removed. These procedures are done meticulously to avoid unnecessary injury to surrounding tissues.</li>\n  <li>Tunnel Creation: Dr. Naveen then creates tunnels or sockets in the tibia (shin bone) and femur (thigh bone) at the sites where the ACL normally attaches. This is done with specialized guides to ensure accurate placement. Proper tunnel placement is critical for the new ACL to function like a natural ligament. In the anatomic technique, these are placed exactly where your original ACL was.</li>\n  <li>Graft Placement: The prepared graft is then passed through the tunnels. For example, a hamstring graft, which looks like a thick rope by now, is pulled into place so that it spans the knee joint, inside the position of the old ACL.</li>\n  <li>Fixation: The graft must be secured at both ends so it stays taut and heals in place. Depending on the technique, this is done by various methods: A common method is to use an interference screw (often a bio-absorbable screw that will eventually dissolve) inside the bone tunnel on the tibia to wedge the graft in place, and a small strong button on the femur that sits on the outer cortex of the bone, suspending the graft. In an all-inside technique, as described earlier, buttons may be used on both ends. In a patellar tendon graft, sometimes screws are used on both ends to fix the bony parts into the tunnels. Dr. Naveen will also test the knee through a range of motion to ensure the graft is secure and the knee moves well without pinching the graft.</li>\n  <li>A common method is to use an interference screw (often a bio-absorbable screw that will eventually dissolve) inside the bone tunnel on the tibia to wedge the graft in place, and a small strong button on the femur that sits on the outer cortex of the bone, suspending the graft.</li>\n  <li>In an all-inside technique, as described earlier, buttons may be used on both ends.

Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V – a renowned sports orthopedic surgeon in HSR Layout – provides advanced ACL tear surgery and personalized care to get you back on your feet. Call us today to schedule your appointment and take the first step toward recovery.\n\nIntroduction to ACL Reconstruction and Its Importance\n\nA torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is a common knee injury that can sideline you from sports and even make everyday activities difficult. The ACL is a key knee ligament that stabilizes your knee during pivoting and sudden movements. When it’s torn (often during sports like football, basketball, or accidents), the knee can buckle or feel unstable. This not only impairs your performance but can also lead to further damage (like meniscus tears or early arthritis) if left untreated.\n\nACL reconstruction surgery is a specialized knee ligament surgery designed to restore stability to an ACL-deficient knee. This procedure replaces the damaged ACL with a new tissue graft, effectively creating a new ligament. This surgery is often crucial for athletes and active individuals who want to return to sports and anyone experiencing knee instability in daily life. By reconstructing the ACL, patients can regain confidence in their knee, prevent recurrent injuries, and protect the joint’s long-term health.\n\nIf you’re in Bangalore (Koramangala, BTM Layout, HSR Layout, or surrounding areas) and suffering from an ACL injury, know that help is available. Our sports injury specialist, Dr. Naveen, will guide you through the journey—from initial assessment to full recovery—so you can get back to the activities you love with a strong and stable knee.\n\nWhy Choose Dr. Naveen for ACL Reconstruction in Bangalore?\n\nChoosing the right doctor for your ACL reconstruction is the most important step toward a successful outcome.

Dr. Naveen employs various techniques and graft types based on what’s best for each patient. Two key aspects define an ACL surgery: the graft choice (what tissue is used to create the new ligament) and the surgical technique (how the graft is placed and fixed in the knee). Below, we break down the options and advanced techniques used in ACL surgeries:\n\nGraft Options for ACL ReconstructionThe “graft” is the tissue that will become your new ACL. We will help you choose the ideal graft depending on your age, activity level, and preferences. Common ACL graft choices include:\n\nHamstring Tendon Autograft: This is one of the most popular grafts. It uses two of your own hamstring tendons (taken from the back of your thigh). Hamstring grafts allow strong ligament reconstruction with relatively small incisions. Patients often have less front-knee pain compared to other grafts, and the strength of a well-prepared hamstring graft is excellent for returning to sports.\n\nPatellar Tendon Autograft (Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone): This technique uses the middle third of your own patellar tendon (just below the kneecap), along with small pieces of bone attached at each end. It has been a “gold standard” for athletes because the bone-to-bone healing can make the graft very secure. Patellar tendon grafts are extremely strong and have a high success rate for athletes in high-demand sports. The trade-off is that some patients might experience temporary pain in the front of the knee or discomfort when kneeling during recovery.\n\nQuadriceps Tendon Autograft: The quadriceps tendon (above the kneecap) is another autograft option, sometimes taken with a small piece of bone. It provides a thick, robust graft—useful in patients who need a larger graft or in revision (repeat) ACL surgeries. Dr. Naveen might choose a quad tendon graft if you have had a previous ACL surgery or if your build and activity needs suggest this as a better option. Many patients tolerate this graft well with low risk of long-term pain.\n\nAllograft (Donor Tissue): In some cases, an allograft (a tendon from a donor/cadaver) may be used. The benefit is that it avoids taking your own tissue, so your own muscles and tendons remain untouched. This can mean a shorter initial surgery and less post-operative discomfort at the harvest site. However, allografts generally take longer to fully incorporate and heal into the bone, and they might have a slightly higher failure rate in young athletic individuals. Dr. Naveen typically reserves allografts for specific situations – such as certain revision surgeries or for older, less active patients – and only uses allograft from highly screened sources to ensure safety.\n\nSynthetic Ligament Grafts: Newer artificial ligament materials (synthetic grafts) have been developed to replace the ACL. While not common, they may be an option in select cases or clinical trials. Synthetic grafts (like the LARS ligament) can offer the advantage of immediate strength and quicker surgery, but historically some have had issues with long-term failure. Dr. Naveen will discuss if a synthetic graft is appropriate or if sticking to biological tissue is the better choice for you (in most cases, your own tissue or a donor tissue is preferred for best healing).\n\nAdvanced Surgical TechniquesIn all ACL reconstructions performed by Sports Orthopedics, arthroscopic surgery is the standard. This means the procedure is done through small keyhole incisions using a camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments, rather than a large open incision. Arthroscopy leads to less pain, minimal scarring, and faster recovery. Within the realm of arthroscopic ACL surgery, there are a few advanced techniques and innovations that Dr. Naveen utilizes:\n\nAnatomic ACL Reconstruction: This isn’t a specific “technique” but a principle Dr. Naveen follows. It means the new ACL is placed in the exact original anatomic position of your natural ACL. By drilling tunnels in the correct anatomical spots on the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), the reconstructed ligament can restore more natural knee mechanics. This leads to better stability, especially for pivoting movements, and reduces the risk of re-injury.\n\nAll-Inside ACL Reconstruction: In a traditional ACL surgery, one end of the graft is often fixed with a screw inside the bone. In an all-inside technique, special sockets (rather than full tunnels) are created in the bones, and the graft is anchored with small, strong buttons on both the femur and tibia. The all-inside approach uses even smaller bone openings and can preserve more bone stock. It often results in less post-op pain at the bone sites and can allow the surgeon to double-loop the hamstring graft to make it thicker. Dr. Naveen may use the all-inside method to maximize graft strength while minimizing tissue trauma, depending on the case.\n\nDouble-Bundle ACL Reconstruction: The ACL has two functional bundles of fibers (anteromedial and posterolateral). In certain patients (like high-level athletes or if anatomy calls for it), Dr. Naveen can perform a double-bundle ACL reconstruction, which uses two separate smaller grafts to recreate both bundles of the ACL. The goal is to mimic the knee’s natural anatomy more closely, potentially giving improved rotational stability. This is a more complex technique and not necessary for every patient, but Dr. Naveen is experienced in it for cases that warrant a double-bundle approach.\n\nInternal Brace Augmentation: For additional support, especially in high-demand athletes or in repair of certain acute ACL tears, Dr. Naveen may use an internal brace. The internal brace is a strong synthetic fiber tape that is implanted alongside the new ACL graft. Think of it as a reinforcement – it helps protect and stabilize the healing graft during the first few critical months. Important: The internal brace is not a replacement for the actual graft; it’s an augmentation to provide extra stability while your tissue heals and strengthens. This technique can potentially allow for a more confident early rehabilitation. Dr. Naveen will consider using an internal brace if it can benefit your recovery (for example, if your ligament tissue quality allows for a partial repair with augmentation, or if you are eager to safely accelerate your rehab).\n\nThe Surgeon will discuss all these options with you before surgery. Rest assured, he is proficient in all the modern ACL reconstruction techniques and will customize the procedure to what best fits your knee condition and lifestyle. Whether it’s choosing the right graft or employing the latest surgical method, the goal is to ensure you have a stable knee that heals well and serves you in the long run.\n\nWhat to Expect Before, During, and After ACL Surgery\n\nFacing surgery can be intimidating, but knowing what to expect can help ease your mind. At our Bangalore clinic, we believe in guiding you through every step of the process – before, during, and after your ACL reconstruction – so you feel comfortable and prepared.\n\nBefore Surgery (Preparation and Prehab)\n\nThorough Evaluation: First, Dr. Naveen will perform a detailed evaluation of your knee. This includes a physical examination and usually an MRI scan to confirm the ACL tear and check for any other injuries (such as meniscus or cartilage damage) that might need attention during surgery. You’ll discuss your medical history, activity goals, and any concerns.\n\nPrehabilitation (“Prehab”): If time allows (for example, if your injury is not extremely recent or if swelling needs to subside), you may be advised to do some prehab exercises with a physiotherapist before surgery. Prehab focuses on gently restoring your knee’s range of motion and strengthening the muscles (especially quadriceps and hamstrings). Going into surgery with a knee that can straighten and bend reasonably well, and with good muscle tone, can actually improve your post-surgery recovery speed. Don’t worry if your knee still feels unstable – you’ll typically wear a brace or be cautious to avoid buckling it during this period.\n\nPreparation and Planning: Dr. Naveen will explain the surgical plan, including the likely graft choice and technique tailored for you. This is a great time to ask any questions about the procedure. You’ll also get instructions for the day of surgery, such as fasting (not eating) for a certain period before the procedure, arranging for someone to drive you home, and preparing your home for post-op comfort (for example, getting ice packs, setting up a rest area, etc.). Our team will make sure all necessary blood tests and medical clearances (like fitness for anesthesia) are done prior to your surgery date.\n\nDuring Surgery (The Procedure Day)\n\nAdmission and Anesthesia: On the day of surgery, you’ll be admitted to the hospital or day-surgery center. ACL reconstruction is typically done under regional (spinal) anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia – meaning you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will discuss the best option for you. Many patients receive a spinal anesthesia (numbing from the waist down) combined with light sleep sedation, so you stay comfortable and pain-free.\n\nArthroscopic Procedure: Dr. Naveen performs the ACL reconstruction arthroscopically. Through 2-3 tiny incisions around your knee, a small camera (arthroscope) and specialized instruments are inserted. First, any additional injuries are addressed – for example, trimming or stitching a torn meniscus if needed. Then, the remnants of the torn ACL are cleared out.\n\nGraft Harvest and Placement: If using an autograft (your tissue), the graft will be harvested through a small incision (for example, a short cut over the upper shin for a hamstring graft, or over the knee for a patellar graft). This incision is kept as small as possible. The graft is prepared to the correct length and thickness. Next, Dr. Naveen will drill precise tunnels or sockets in your thigh and shin bones at the anatomic ACL attachment sites. The prepared graft is then passed through the knee and fixed securely into these bone tunnels – usually with devices like strong absorbable screws or suspensory buttons. (In an all-inside technique, as mentioned earlier, the fixation might be done entirely with buttons on both ends.) Dr. Naveen ensures the graft is properly tensioned (tight but not over-tight) and that your knee has full range of motion without impingement of the graft.\n\nDuration and Wake Up: The surgery typically takes about 1 to 1.5 hours, though it can vary depending on complexity (for example, if we also repair other ligaments or a meniscus, it could be a bit longer). After the procedure, you’ll be moved to a recovery room as the anesthesia wears off. Don’t be surprised if you wake up with a padded bandage on your knee and maybe a brace; this is normal. Our team will monitor you until you’re fully awake and comfortable.\n\nSame-Day Discharge: ACL reconstruction is often a day-care surgery, meaning many patients go home the same day once they recover from anesthesia. In some cases, an overnight stay might be recommended (especially if surgery is done late in the day or if additional procedures were performed). Either way, you won’t be in the hospital for long.\n\nAfter Surgery (Recovery and Rehabilitation)\n\nImmediate Post-Op: When you go home, your knee will be wrapped and possibly in a knee brace locked in a straight position (depending on Dr. Naveen’s instructions and whether any other repairs were done). You’ll likely be given crutches or a walker for support. Pain is managed with medications – expect some soreness, but many patients find it’s less than they anticipated thanks to modern arthroscopic techniques and pain control methods. We’ll advise you on icing the knee regularly to keep swelling down.\n\nWeight-Bearing and Mobility: Surprisingly, you will be encouraged to start moving the same day or next day. In many cases, if only the ACL was reconstructed and the knee is stable, you can start walking with support almost immediately (typically with crutches or a walker for balance). Dr. Naveen often allows partial to full weight-bearing as tolerated right after surgery, especially if no other structures (like meniscus) need protection. For the first week, you’ll use support and avoid long periods on your feet, but basic walking around the house is encouraged. By the end of the first week, many patients can put more weight on the leg and may even begin walking short distances without support (if advised by the doctor or physio). Everyone is a bit different, so follow the specific guidance given to you.\n\nFollow-Up and Physiotherapy: You’ll have a follow-up appointment within a week or two after surgery. Stitches (if any external ones) will be removed around 10-14 days. The physiotherapy (rehab) program starts almost immediately in the first week. Initially, the focus is on gentle exercises to regain knee range of motion (especially achieving full straightening and gradual bending) and to prevent muscle stiffness. A physiotherapist will teach you exercises and monitor your progress. Strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstrings begin in a controlled way. By 4-6 weeks, the goal is usually to have near-normal walking without aids, full extension and a good bend in the knee, and improving muscle strength.\n\nRehabilitation Phases\n\nWeeks 0-6: Protective phase\n\nreduce swelling, restore motion, begin basic strength exercises. You’ll work on straightening the knee fully and bending it to at least 90-120 degrees gradually.\n\n3 to 6 Months: Advanced training\n\nhigher level strengthening, agility drills, and gentle sport-specific movements under guidance.\n\nWeeks 6-12: Strength and balance phase\n\nmore intensive strengthening of the leg muscles, balance training, and core strengthening.\n\n6 to 9 Months: Return to sport\n\nMost patients are ready to carefully return to full sports or intense physical activities around the 6-8 month mark post-surgery with doctor’s approval.\n\nTestimonials\n\nI tore my ACL while playing football and feared my sports days were over. Dr. Naveen performed my ACL reconstruction and guided me through rehab. Six months later, I was back on the field stronger than ever! I’m incredibly thankful for his expertise and encouragement throughout my recovery.\n\nRohit K\n\nKoramangala, Bangalore\n\nAfter my knee injury, I consulted several doctors but still felt nervous about surgery. Meeting Dr. Naveen put me at ease. He explained everything about the ACL tear and surgery in a way I could understand. The surgery went smoothly and the support I received was fantastic. It’s been 7 months now and I’m jogging and trekking again without any instability. Choosing Dr. Naveen was the best decision for my knee.\n\nPriya M\n\nHSR Layout, Bangalore\n\nI had a complete ACL and meniscus tear from a bike accident. Dr. Naveen did an excellent job with the reconstruction and also repaired my meniscus. I was walking with support within a week and recovered much faster than I expected. His rehab team was top-notch, pushing me just the right amount. Today, I can climb stairs, run, and even play badminton with confidence. Big thanks to Dr. Naveen and his team for giving me my life back\n\nAnil S\n\nElectronic City, Bangalore\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow do I know if I have torn my ACL?\n\nA torn ACL often happens with a sudden twisting injury to the knee – for example, landing from a jump and twisting, or a quick change of direction while running. Patients often report hearing or feeling a “pop” in the knee at the moment of injury. Other common symptoms include immediate swelling of the knee (within the first few hours), pain (especially deep inside the knee), and a feeling of instability or “giving way” when you try to put weight on that leg. However, not all ACL tears cause severe pain after the initial injury – some people just notice the instability later when they return to activity.\n\nIf you suspect an ACL tear, it’s important to see a doctor. Dr. Naveen will perform specific clinical tests on your knee (like the Lachman test or pivot shift test) to check the ACL. An MRI scan is usually ordered to confirm the diagnosis, as it can visualize the ACL and also reveal any other injuries (like meniscus tears or bone bruises) that might have occurred with the ACL tear. In summary, if your knee swelled up after an injury and now feels wobbly or unreliable, you should get it evaluated for a possible ACL tear.\n\nDoes a torn ACL always require surgery?\n\nNot always – it depends on your lifestyle and the degree of instability. An ACL tear will not heal on its own (since the ligament ends retract and there’s poor blood supply), but not everyone needs surgery. If you are a very sedentary person or willing to give up pivoting sports, and if your knee feels generally stable in straight-line activities, you might manage without surgery. The treatment in such cases is focused on physiotherapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles (especially quads and hamstrings) to compensate for the missing ACL, and possibly wearing a brace during high-risk activities. Some people can cope with an ACL-deficient knee for everyday life, especially older individuals or those with very low activity demands.\n\nHowever, if you’re young or active, or if you experience your knee “giving way” even during simple tasks, surgery is often strongly recommended. Repeated instability episodes can cause further damage like cartilage wear or meniscus tears. For anyone who wants to return to sports, running, or an active lifestyle, an ACL reconstruction is usually the best solution to restore full stability. Dr. Naveen will assess your knee and discuss your activity goals – if you aim to get back to a sport or high-demand activities, he will likely advise that reconstruction surgery is the safest route to protect your knee long-term.\n\nWho should consider ACL reconstruction surgery?\n\nYou should consider ACL reconstruction if you have a torn ACL and any of the following apply to you:\n\nYou are an athlete or recreational sportsperson who wants to return to sports that involve cutting, jumping, or quick direction changes (e.g., football, basketball, tennis, badminton, etc.).\n\nYour knee feels unstable or gives way during everyday activities (going down stairs, stepping off a curb, turning while walking). Even if you’re not an athlete, instability in daily life is problematic and can risk further injury.\n\nYou have additional injuries (like a meniscus tear) that were treated, but the knee might still be unstable without an ACL.\n\nYou are relatively young or otherwise active and wish to maintain an active lifestyle without restricting yourself due to fear of the knee giving out.\n\nYou’ve tried conservative management (therapy, bracing) for a while and still have instability or lack of confidence in your knee.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re older or have very low activity demands and your knee isn’t buckling, you might elect not to have surgery. Ultimately, the decision is personalized. Dr. Naveen will help you weigh the pros and cons based on your situation. His goal is to ensure that if you do undergo ACL reconstruction, you truly need it and will benefit from it.\n\nWhat happens if I don’t get ACL surgery for a torn ACL?\n\nIf you choose not to have surgery and you have an ACL tear, the main concern is ongoing knee instability. Without the ACL, your knee may continue to give way at unpredictable times, especially with any sudden turns or awkward steps. This is not just a functional problem; it can lead to further damage inside the knee. Every time the knee buckles, there’s a risk of secondary injuries like tearing the meniscus (the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee) or damaging the articular cartilage (which can eventually lead to arthritis). In fact, many chronic ACL-deficient knees develop meniscus tears over time due to the repeated stress and sliding in the joint.\n\nAdditionally, you might have to significantly modify your activities. Sports that involve pivoting or jumping would likely be off-limits. Even hiking on uneven terrain or dancing can become risky. Some people adapt by giving up these activities or by wearing a stabilizing brace during them, but it’s a compromise.\n\nThat said, if your knee is mostly stable in straight-line activities and you are disciplined about avoiding high-risk movements, you might do okay without an ACL. You would need to maintain strong leg muscles through exercise to help compensate for the lost ligament. Regular check-ups would be wise to monitor knee health. Dr. Naveen may recommend a structured rehab and a trial of non-surgical management to see if you can cope. If it becomes clear that instability is affecting your quality of life, you can always decide to proceed with surgery later. Keep in mind, though, if too much time passes with ongoing instability, any new damage (like a large meniscus tear) could make the eventual surgery and recovery more complex.\n\nHow is ACL reconstruction surgery performed?\n\nACL reconstruction is performed arthroscopically (through small incisions using a camera). The general steps are:\n\nArthroscopic Evaluation: After you’re under anesthesia, Dr. Naveen makes two or three tiny incisions around the knee. Saline fluid is used to expand the knee joint, and a fiber-optic camera is inserted so the inside of your knee can be seen on a monitor. He will inspect all structures in the knee joint – ACL (confirm it’s torn), PCL, both menisci, cartilage surfaces, etc. Any loose fragments from the torn ACL are removed.\n\nAddress Additional Injuries: If there are any co-injuries (for example, a torn meniscus or a cartilage flap), those are addressed first. A meniscus tear might be trimmed (meniscectomy) or stitched (meniscus repair) depending on its type and location. This ensures the knee is “cleaned up” and ready for the new ACL.\n\nGraft Harvest: If an autograft is being used (like your hamstring or patellar tendon), a small incision is made to obtain that graft. For a hamstring graft, two small tendons are carefully detached from the hamstring muscle and pulled out; they are then cleaned and bundled to form a strong new “ligament”. For a patellar tendon graft, a strip of tendon with small bone blocks is removed. These procedures are done meticulously to avoid unnecessary injury to surrounding tissues.\n\nTunnel Creation: Dr. Naveen then creates tunnels or sockets in the tibia (shin bone) and femur (thigh bone) at the sites where the ACL normally attaches. This is done with specialized guides to ensure accurate placement. Proper tunnel placement is critical for the new ACL to function like a natural ligament. In the anatomic technique, these are placed exactly where your original ACL was.\n\nGraft Placement: The prepared graft is then passed through the tunnels. For example, a hamstring graft, which looks like a thick rope by now, is pulled into place so that it spans the knee joint, inside the position of the old ACL.\n\nFixation: The graft must be secured at both ends so it stays taut and heals in place. Depending on the technique, this is done by various methods:\n\nA common method is to use an interference screw (often a bio-absorbable screw that will eventually dissolve) inside the bone tunnel on the tibia to wedge the graft in place, and a small strong button on the femur that sits on the outer cortex of the bone, suspending the graft.\n\nIn an all-inside technique, as described earlier, buttons may be used on both ends. In a patellar tendon graft, sometimes screws are used on both ends to fix the bony parts into the tunnels.\n\nDr. Naveen will also test the knee through a range of motion to ensure the graft is secure and the knee moves well without pinching the graft.\n\nClosure: Once the new ACL is in place and everything looks good, the small incisions are closed (a couple of stitches or steri-strips). The knee is bandaged and often a brace is applied to keep it straight initially.\n\nThe entire surgery is usually completed within 1-2 hours. It’s amazing that such a complex procedure can be done through tiny incisions — thanks to modern arthroscopy and Dr. Naveen’s skilled hands. Patients often go home the same day. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, the post-operative pain and stiffness are much less than older, open-knee techniques.",

Regain your mobility and live pain-free with advanced knee replacement surgery by Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. in Bangalore’s Sports Orthopedics Institute. Our compassionate team is here to guide you from initial consultation to full recovery.</p>\n<p>Book an Appointment to take the first step towards pain-free knees.</p>\n<p>If you’re in Bangalore (Koramangala, BTM Layout, HSR Layout, Bellandur, Sarjapur Road, Electronic City, Marathahalli, or Indiranagar) and suffering from severe knee pain or arthritis, know that help is available. Total knee replacement – also known as knee arthroplasty or arthritis knee surgery – is a procedure to replace a damaged knee joint with an artificial joint made of metal and high-grade plastic. This new knee joint takes over the work of your worn-out cartilage and bone, allowing smooth, pain-free movement. Knee replacement is one of the most successful surgeries in modern medicine, providing significant pain relief and improved mobility for most patients. It’s considered a safe procedure with a very low complication rate (serious issues occur in fewer than 2% of patients)​, and over 90% of modern knee implants still work well 15+ years after surgery​.</p>\n<h3>Who might need a knee replacement?</h3>\n<p>Knee replacement is typically recommended for people with advanced knee arthritis or serious joint damage. If you have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis causing constant knee pain, stiffness, and difficulty with everyday activities, you might be a candidate for this surgery. Common reasons to consider knee replacement include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Severe arthritis pain: Osteoarthritis (age-related wear and tear) or rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory) can lead to bone-on-bone contact in the knee, causing intense pain and deformity. When pain persists despite medications, physiotherapy, and injections, knee arthritis surgery (replacement) may be the best solution.</li>\n  <li>Limited mobility: Difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, or getting up from chairs due to knee pain or stiffness. You may find you’re avoiding activities you enjoy because your knee just won’t cooperate.</li>\n  <li>Night pain or rest pain: Pain that keeps you awake at night or aches even when you’re not moving is a red flag. It means the joint damage is quite severe.</li>\n  <li>Bent or deformed knee joint: Long-standing arthritis can cause the knee to bow inward or outward. Total knee replacement can straighten the leg and correct these deformities, improving your gait.</li>\n  <li>Previous injuries or others: Sometimes old fractures or ligament injuries lead to post-traumatic arthritis. If your knee was damaged in the past and now you have chronic pain and instability, replacement might be recommended. Also, conditions like avascular necrosis or infections that destroy the joint can necessitate a new joint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, anyone with chronic knee pain and disability that is not improved by conservative treatments should consult a knee specialist. Our knee pain specialist (Dr. Naveen) will evaluate your condition through X-rays, physical exam, and history. We always exhaust simpler options (medications, bracing, injections) before suggesting surgery. If non-surgical measures aren’t giving relief and your quality of life is suffering, it might be time to consider a total knee replacement to get you back to an active, pain-free life.</p>\n<h3>Expertise & Qualifications</h3>\n<h3>Sports Injury Specialist</h3>\n<h3>Advanced Techniques & Technology</h3>\n<h3>High Volume, High Success</h3>\n<h3>Personalized Care</h3>\n<h3>Convenient Location</h3>\n<p>Not all knee problems are the same, so knee replacement surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Dr. Naveen will recommend the type of procedure that best suits your condition, knee anatomy, age, and lifestyle goals. Here are the main types of knee replacement procedures offered at our Bangalore clinic:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Total Knee Replacement (TKR): This is the most common procedure and what most people refer to as “knee replacement.” In a TKR, the surgeon replaces both sides of the knee joint (the lower end of the thigh bone and the upper end of the shin bone, and often the back of the kneecap) with prosthetic components. Essentially, all the damaged cartilage and a small amount of underlying bone are removed, and metal components are fixed in place, with a special medical-grade plastic spacer in between. The result is a new joint surface that glides smoothly. Total knee replacement is ideal when arthritis is widespread throughout the knee. It reliably relieves pain and corrects deformity. Most patients who undergo TKR experience dramatic pain reduction and improved function – the new knee can bend and bear weight without the grinding pain you had before. (Fun fact: a replaced knee behaves like a normal knee in terms of movement once you recover from surgery​</li>\n  <li>Partial Knee Replacement (Unicondylar Knee Replacement): Not every arthritic knee needs a full replacement. In some patients, only one part of the knee joint is severely damaged (either the inner side, outer side, or the kneecap joint). In such cases, a partial knee replacement can be a great option. This surgery replaces only the affected compartment of the knee and leaves the healthy parts untouched. Because it’s a smaller intervention, partial replacements often involve a smaller incision, less bone removal, and a quicker recovery. Patients often report the knee feels “more natural” since ligaments are preserved. However, a partial knee replacement is only suitable if the damage is truly limited to one area – Dr. Naveen will use advanced imaging and examination to determine this. If arthritis is likely to progress to other parts of the knee, a total replacement may be recommended instead. When appropriate, though, partial knee surgery can give excellent results with shorter hospital stays and rehabilitation time.</li>\n  <li>Bilateral Knee Replacement: If both knees are badly arthritic, you might eventually need replacement in both. This can be done either simultaneously (during one surgical session) or staged (separate surgeries a few months apart). Dr. Naveen has extensive experience with simultaneous bilateral knee replacements for patients who need it – for example, if both knees are equally painful and the patient is medically fit. Doing both at once means one anesthesia event and a single rehabilitation period for both knees, which some patients prefer to get everything done in one go. Others may opt to do one knee at a time (staged) to focus on one recovery at a time. Either approach can be safe and effective. Dr. Naveen will discuss the pros and cons with you, considering factors like your age, fitness, and support at home. Many of our bilateral knee patients are thrilled to get rid of pain in both knees and often say they wish they had done it sooner.</li>\n  <li>Revision Knee Replacement: A knee replacement is designed to last many years – typically 15-20 years or more in 80-90% of patients​. However, if you are younger or very active, or if complications occur, a revision surgery might be needed down the line. Revision means replacing an old or failed implant with a new one. This is a more complex surgery because there may be bone loss or scar tissue to manage, and specialized implants are often required. Dr. Naveen is highly experienced in revision knee surgery, having trained in centers in the UK for complex joint revisions. Common reasons for revision include implant wear-and-tear (loosening), infection, or instability. If you had a knee replacement elsewhere that is now giving trouble, we can evaluate and, if needed, perform a safe revision to get you back on track.</li>\n  <li>Robotic-Assisted Knee Replacement: Our center is proud to offer robotic knee replacement technology. Dr. Naveen is one of the few surgeons in Bangalore certified in the Mako robotic system for knee replacements. In a robotic-assisted procedure, a 3D model of your knee is created from a CT scan, and a robotic arm helps the surgeon execute the bone cuts with sub-millimeter precision. Don’t worry – the surgery is still performed by Dr. Naveen; the robot is a tool that ensures perfect alignment and placement as per the plan. The potential benefits of robotic surgery include more accurate implant positioning (which may improve the knee’s natural feel and longevity), less soft tissue damage, and possibly a faster recovery with less pain. If you’re a candidate for robotic surgery, Dr. Naveen will discuss this option. Whether done with traditional instruments or the aid of a robot, the goal is the same: a well-balanced knee that moves freely and lasts a long time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Dr. Naveen will customize the surgical plan for you. Every knee is unique. We take into account your age, activity level, knee anatomy, and overall health before recommending any procedure. Rest assured, you will get an honest opinion – if you do not need surgery, we’ll tell you that too! And if you do, we’ll choose the type of knee replacement that maximizes your benefits and minimizes risks.</p>\n<p>Facing surgery can be intimidating – but knowing what to expect can help ease your mind. We believe an informed patient is a more comfortable patient! Here’s an overview of the journey when you undergo total knee replacement with Dr. Naveen:</p>\n<h3>Before Surgery: Preparing for Your Knee Replacement</h3>\n<p>Thorough evaluation: Once you and Dr. Naveen decide to proceed with knee replacement, our team will conduct a detailed pre-surgery evaluation. This includes blood tests, cardiac check-up, and any other necessary investigations to ensure you’re fit for anesthesia and surgery. We’ll review your current medications. (For example, if you’re on blood thinners or certain arthritis meds, you may need to stop them a week prior.) It’s important to have conditions like diabetes or blood pressure well controlled before surgery.</p>\n<p>Personalized planning: Dr. Naveen will take precise measurements of your knee via X-rays or scans to plan the surgery. If a robotic surgery is planned, a CT scan might be done to map your knee. We’ll also discuss the type of anesthesia with you – typically either a spinal anesthesia (which numbs your legs but you are awake or lightly sedated) or general anesthesia (where you’re fully asleep). Both are safe; the anesthesiologist will recommend the best option in your case.</p>\n<p>Pre-hab and lifestyle tweaks: Often, we recommend some physiotherapy exercises in the weeks leading up to surgery (“pre-hab”). Strengthening your thigh and calf muscles beforehand can speed up recovery. If you smoke, this is a great time to stop – smoking can slow down wound healing. We’ll also guide you on any weight loss or diet changes if needed, because a healthier body heals better. Arrange for support at home – for the first couple of weeks post-surgery, having a family member or friend to help with chores will make recovery smoother. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure you have a walker or crutches and other assistive devices ready for when you leave the hospital.</p>\n<h3>During Surgery: The Day of Your Knee Replacement</h3>\n<p>On the day of surgery, you’ll be admitted to the hospital (if not already the night before). Dr. Naveen will meet you before the procedure to answer any last-minute questions and mark the surgical site. Expect to be in the operating room for around 1 to 2 hours for a knee replacement procedure. Here’s a quick rundown of what happens during the surgery:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Anesthesia & prep: You’ll receive the spinal or general anesthesia as discussed. Once you’re comfortably anesthetized (you won’t feel any pain during the operation), the surgical team cleans your knee and leg with antiseptic solution to maintain a sterile environment and reduces infection risk.</li>\n  <li>Surgery steps: Dr. Naveen makes an incision (cut) in front of the knee to access the joint. The size of the incision can vary (usually around 6-10 inches, smaller in minimally invasive approaches). The damaged ends of the thigh bone (femur) and shin bone (tibia) are carefully removed or reshaped using special guides. Any remaining damaged cartilage is cleared. If the kneecap (patella) underside is worn out, that may be smoothed or a plastic button put in place. Then the artificial components – contoured metal pieces for femur and tibia, and a plastic spacer that sits between them – are implanted. These components may be cemented into place with bone cement or be of a type that allows your bone to grow onto them. Dr. Naveen pays close attention to aligning your leg correctly and balancing the ligaments so that the knee bends and straightens with proper tension (this is critical for a good result). If robotic assistance is used, the robot ensures the cuts match the plan perfectly.</li>\n  <li>Closing up: Once the new knee components are in place and everything looks good, the incision is closed with sutures or staples. You’ll have a dressing (bandage) applied over the incision. The whole process is meticulous but efficient in Dr. Naveen’s experienced hands. Right after surgery, you’ll be moved to a recovery area where nurses and doctors monitor you as you wake up from anesthesia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pain management: Even before you wake up, we take steps to manage pain. Often, Dr. Naveen or the anesthesiology team will put a nerve block (an injection to numb nerves in the leg) or inject local anesthetic around the knee during surgery. This greatly reduces post-op pain in the first day or two. You’ll also be given IV pain medications as needed. Our goal is to keep you comfortable – some pain is normal after any surgery, but we keep it at a tolerable level so you can start moving and rehabbing quickly.</p>\n<h3>After Surgery: Recovery and Rehabilitation</h3>\n<p>Congratulations – you have a new knee! Now the focus shifts to recovery and helping you get the most out of your knee replacement. Here’s what happens after the operation:</p>\n<p>In the hospital: You will stay in the hospital for a short period after surgery. Many patients spend about 2–4 days in the hospital​, though this can vary.</p>\n<p>On Day 1 (the same evening or next morning after surgery), physiotherapists will start working with you. Initially, it’s gentle movements: wiggling your toes, moving your ankles, and doing static exercises like pressing the back of your knee down into the bed (to engage your thigh muscles). These help improve circulation and prevent stiffness.</p>\n<p>By Day 2, most patients will sit up and dangle their legs at the bedside and even take a few steps with a walker under supervision​. Don’t be surprised – yes, we get you up and walking very soon after knee replacement! Early movement is key to preventing blood clots and speeding recovery. You’ll have a drip for fluids and maybe a drain in your knee (to remove any excess fluid from the joint area) for a day. Nurses will give you medications to manage pain and prevent clots (usually a blood thinner injection or pill).</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation and physiotherapy: Physical therapy is your best friend after knee replacement. Our expert physiotherapists will guide you through exercises to gradually increase your knee’s range of motion and strengthen the muscles. Initially, it might be a bit challenging, but each day gets better. You’ll practice bending the knee more each day (usually aiming for at least 90 degrees bend before leaving hospital) and strengthening exercises like gentle leg lifts. By the time you’re discharged, you will be walking with a walker or crutches on your own for short distances (like around the room or hallway). We’ll teach you how to safely climb stairs with assistance if needed (typically: “up with the good leg, down with the operated leg” using support).</p>\n<p>Going home: Most people go home after their hospital stay; some might go to a short-term rehab facility if extra help is needed (though with our robust home physiotherapy network, that’s rarely necessary). At home, you will continue physiotherapy — either with a professional coming to your home or by visiting our center periodically, depending on what’s convenient. You’ll have some staples or stitches on your incision that will be removed about 2 weeks after surgery (we’ll schedule a follow-up for that). During the first 2-3 weeks, you’ll likely use a walker, then progress to a cane, and eventually walk without support when you feel steady (often by around 2-3 weeks you can walk short distances without the walker​, and by 4-6 weeks more confidently).</p>\n<p>Pain and medication: It’s normal to have moderate pain for a few weeks, but it improves steadily. We will prescribe pain relief tablets that you can take as needed. Many patients find their pain is well controlled with medications by the end of week 1 or 2. The knee might be swollen for a few weeks – icing and elevating the leg help reduce swelling. Keep in mind, the “pain after knee replacement” is temporary and very manageable, and it’s different from the arthritis pain you had (post-surgery pain lessens week by week, whereas arthritis pain would only worsen without surgery). We’ll also guide you on wound care and signs of any issues to watch (though problems are uncommon, we stay proactive).</p>\n<p>Follow-ups: You’ll have regular follow-up appointments with Dr. Naveen – usually at 2 weeks (for stitch removal and check-up), 6 weeks, 3 months, and so on. During these visits, we check your range of motion (most patients get back to 120-130 degrees bend eventually), and take X-rays to ensure the implants are in good position. Dr. Naveen will also discuss gradually resuming activities. By 6 weeks, many patients are walking without a cane and doing most daily activities like shopping or light housekeeping. By 3 months, you should be doing very well – walking longer distances, climbing stairs better, and maybe doing gentle exercises like stationary cycling or swimming. Over 6-12 months, any residual stiffness keeps improving. You can expect to return to an active lifestyle – not high-impact sports, but things like walking, golf, cycling, yoga are typically fine (and encouraged!). Your new knee won’t prevent you from traveling or enjoying hobbies; it’s there to enable those things with far less pain than before.</p>\n<p>A new lease on life: Most people find that by 3 to 6 months post-op, they hardly think about their knee anymore – it just works. They can walk without limping, climb stairs normally, and most importantly, they have relief from the constant pain that plagued them. You’ll likely wonder why you didn’t do it sooner! We’ve had patients tell us that knee replacement was “life-changing” – being able to play with grandkids, take morning walks in the park, or even go on trekking vacations that were impossible before. Our team will continue to be a resource for you even after you’re fully recovered. We’re just a phone call away if you have questions during rehab or even years later.</p>\n<p>Your commitment: Successful recovery does require some effort from your side – mainly doing your physiotherapy exercises and staying active as advised. Think of it as a partnership: Dr. Naveen provides a brand new knee, and you put in the work to make it strong and functional. Don’t worry, we’ll support you throughout. And remember, every patient’s recovery timeline is a little different – so don’t be discouraged if your friend was off the walker in 2 weeks and you take 4 weeks. Steady progress is what matters, and we’ll ensure you keep moving forward.</p>\n<p>S.

Total knee replacement – also known as knee arthroplasty or arthritis knee surgery – is a procedure to replace a damaged knee joint with an artificial joint made of metal and high-grade plastic. This new knee joint takes over the work of your worn-out cartilage and bone, allowing smooth, pain-free movement. Knee replacement is one of the most successful surgeries in modern medicine, providing significant pain relief and improved mobility for most patients. It’s considered a safe procedure with a very low complication rate (serious issues occur in fewer than 2% of patients)​, and over 90% of modern knee implants still work well 15+ years after surgery​.\n\nWho might need a knee replacement?\n\nKnee replacement is typically recommended for people with advanced knee arthritis or serious joint damage. If you have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis causing constant knee pain, stiffness, and difficulty with everyday activities, you might be a candidate for this surgery. Common reasons to consider knee replacement include:\n\nSevere arthritis pain: Osteoarthritis (age-related wear and tear) or rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory) can lead to bone-on-bone contact in the knee, causing intense pain and deformity. When pain persists despite medications, physiotherapy, and injections, knee arthritis surgery (replacement) may be the best solution.\n\nLimited mobility: Difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, or getting up from chairs due to knee pain or stiffness. You may find you’re avoiding activities you enjoy because your knee just won’t cooperate.\n\nNight pain or rest pain: Pain that keeps you awake at night or aches even when you’re not moving is a red flag. It means the joint damage is quite severe.\n\nBent or deformed knee joint: Long-standing arthritis can cause the knee to bow inward or outward. Total knee replacement can straighten the leg and correct these deformities, improving your gait.\n\nPrevious injuries or others: Sometimes old fractures or ligament injuries lead to post-traumatic arthritis. If your knee was damaged in the past and now you have chronic pain and instability, replacement might be recommended. Also, conditions like avascular necrosis or infections that destroy the joint can necessitate a new joint.\n\nIn short, anyone with chronic knee pain and disability that is not improved by conservative treatments should consult a knee specialist. Our knee pain specialist (Dr. Naveen) will evaluate your condition through X-rays, physical exam, and history. We always exhaust simpler options (medications, bracing, injections) before suggesting surgery. If non-surgical measures aren’t giving relief and your quality of life is suffering, it might be time to consider a total knee replacement to get you back to an active, pain-free life.\n\nWhy Choose Dr. Naveen for Knee Replacement in Bangalore?\n\nChoosing the right surgeon is crucial for a successful knee replacement.

His blend of top-notch surgical skill, advanced technology, and genuine care for patients makes him an ideal choice if you are considering knee replacement. We strive to provide the best knee surgery experience – from the first consultation in our HSR Layout clinic (easily reachable from Koramangala, BTM Layout, Bellandur, Sarjapur Road, Electronic City, Marathahalli, Indiranagar, and other areas) all the way through your successful recovery.\n\nTypes of Knee Replacement Procedures\n\nNot all knee problems are the same, so knee replacement surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Dr. Naveen will recommend the type of procedure that best suits your condition, knee anatomy, age, and lifestyle goals. Here are the main types of knee replacement procedures offered at our Bangalore clinic:\n\nTotal Knee Replacement (TKR): This is the most common procedure and what most people refer to as “knee replacement.” In a TKR, the surgeon replaces both sides of the knee joint (the lower end of the thigh bone and the upper end of the shin bone, and often the back of the kneecap) with prosthetic components. Essentially, all the damaged cartilage and a small amount of underlying bone are removed, and metal components are fixed in place, with a special medical-grade plastic spacer in between. The result is a new joint surface that glides smoothly. Total knee replacement is ideal when arthritis is widespread throughout the knee. It reliably relieves pain and corrects deformity. Most patients who undergo TKR experience dramatic pain reduction and improved function – the new knee can bend and bear weight without the grinding pain you had before. (Fun fact: a replaced knee behaves like a normal knee in terms of movement once you recover from surgery​\n\nPartial Knee Replacement (Unicondylar Knee Replacement): Not every arthritic knee needs a full replacement. In some patients, only one part of the knee joint is severely damaged (either the inner side, outer side, or the kneecap joint). In such cases, a partial knee replacement can be a great option. This surgery replaces only the affected compartment of the knee and leaves the healthy parts untouched. Because it’s a smaller intervention, partial replacements often involve a smaller incision, less bone removal, and a quicker recovery. Patients often report the knee feels “more natural” since ligaments are preserved. However, a partial knee replacement is only suitable if the damage is truly limited to one area – Dr. Naveen will use advanced imaging and examination to determine this. If arthritis is likely to progress to other parts of the knee, a total replacement may be recommended instead. When appropriate, though, partial knee surgery can give excellent results with shorter hospital stays and rehabilitation time.\n\nBilateral Knee Replacement: If both knees are badly arthritic, you might eventually need replacement in both. This can be done either simultaneously (during one surgical session) or staged (separate surgeries a few months apart). Dr. Naveen has extensive experience with simultaneous bilateral knee replacements for patients who need it – for example, if both knees are equally painful and the patient is medically fit. Doing both at once means one anesthesia event and a single rehabilitation period for both knees, which some patients prefer to get everything done in one go. Others may opt to do one knee at a time (staged) to focus on one recovery at a time. Either approach can be safe and effective. Dr. Naveen will discuss the pros and cons with you, considering factors like your age, fitness, and support at home. Many of our bilateral knee patients are thrilled to get rid of pain in both knees and often say they wish they had done it sooner.\n\nRevision Knee Replacement: A knee replacement is designed to last many years – typically 15-20 years or more in 80-90% of patients​. However, if you are younger or very active, or if complications occur, a revision surgery might be needed down the line. Revision means replacing an old or failed implant with a new one. This is a more complex surgery because there may be bone loss or scar tissue to manage, and specialized implants are often required. Dr. Naveen is highly experienced in revision knee surgery, having trained in centers in the UK for complex joint revisions. Common reasons for revision include implant wear-and-tear (loosening), infection, or instability. If you had a knee replacement elsewhere that is now giving trouble, we can evaluate and, if needed, perform a safe revision to get you back on track.\n\nRobotic-Assisted Knee Replacement: Our center is proud to offer robotic knee replacement technology. Dr. Naveen is one of the few surgeons in Bangalore certified in the Mako robotic system for knee replacements. In a robotic-assisted procedure, a 3D model of your knee is created from a CT scan, and a robotic arm helps the surgeon execute the bone cuts with sub-millimeter precision. Don’t worry – the surgery is still performed by Dr. Naveen; the robot is a tool that ensures perfect alignment and placement as per the plan. The potential benefits of robotic surgery include more accurate implant positioning (which may improve the knee’s natural feel and longevity), less soft tissue damage, and possibly a faster recovery with less pain. If you’re a candidate for robotic surgery, Dr. Naveen will discuss this option. Whether done with traditional instruments or the aid of a robot, the goal is the same: a well-balanced knee that moves freely and lasts a long time.\n\nNote: Dr. Naveen will customize the surgical plan for you. Every knee is unique. We take into account your age, activity level, knee anatomy, and overall health before recommending any procedure. Rest assured, you will get an honest opinion – if you do not need surgery, we’ll tell you that too! And if you do, we’ll choose the type of knee replacement that maximizes your benefits and minimizes risks.\n\nWhat to Expect: Before, During, and After Surgery\n\nFacing surgery can be intimidating – but knowing what to expect can help ease your mind. We believe an informed patient is a more comfortable patient! Here’s an overview of the journey when you undergo total knee replacement with Dr. Naveen:\n\nBefore Surgery: Preparing for Your Knee Replacement\n\nThorough evaluation: Once you and Dr. Naveen decide to proceed with knee replacement, our team will conduct a detailed pre-surgery evaluation. This includes blood tests, cardiac check-up, and any other necessary investigations to ensure you’re fit for anesthesia and surgery. We’ll review your current medications. (For example, if you’re on blood thinners or certain arthritis meds, you may need to stop them a week prior.) It’s important to have conditions like diabetes or blood pressure well controlled before surgery.\n\nPersonalized planning: Dr. Naveen will take precise measurements of your knee via X-rays or scans to plan the surgery. If a robotic surgery is planned, a CT scan might be done to map your knee. We’ll also discuss the type of anesthesia with you – typically either a spinal anesthesia (which numbs your legs but you are awake or lightly sedated) or general anesthesia (where you’re fully asleep). Both are safe; the anesthesiologist will recommend the best option in your case.\n\nPre-hab and lifestyle tweaks: Often, we recommend some physiotherapy exercises in the weeks leading up to surgery (“pre-hab”). Strengthening your thigh and calf muscles beforehand can speed up recovery. If you smoke, this is a great time to stop – smoking can slow down wound healing. We’ll also guide you on any weight loss or diet changes if needed, because a healthier body heals better. Arrange for support at home – for the first couple of weeks post-surgery, having a family member or friend to help with chores will make recovery smoother. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure you have a walker or crutches and other assistive devices ready for when you leave the hospital.\n\nDuring Surgery: The Day of Your Knee Replacement\n\nOn the day of surgery, you’ll be admitted to the hospital (if not already the night before). Dr. Naveen will meet you before the procedure to answer any last-minute questions and mark the surgical site. Expect to be in the operating room for around 1 to 2 hours for a knee replacement procedure. Here’s a quick rundown of what happens during the surgery:\n\nAnesthesia & prep: You’ll receive the spinal or general anesthesia as discussed. Once you’re comfortably anesthetized (you won’t feel any pain during the operation), the surgical team cleans your knee and leg with antiseptic solution to maintain a sterile environment and reduces infection risk.\n\nSurgery steps: Dr. Naveen makes an incision (cut) in front of the knee to access the joint. The size of the incision can vary (usually around 6-10 inches, smaller in minimally invasive approaches). The damaged ends of the thigh bone (femur) and shin bone (tibia) are carefully removed or reshaped using special guides. Any remaining damaged cartilage is cleared. If the kneecap (patella) underside is worn out, that may be smoothed or a plastic button put in place. Then the artificial components – contoured metal pieces for femur and tibia, and a plastic spacer that sits between them – are implanted. These components may be cemented into place with bone cement or be of a type that allows your bone to grow onto them. Dr. Naveen pays close attention to aligning your leg correctly and balancing the ligaments so that the knee bends and straightens with proper tension (this is critical for a good result). If robotic assistance is used, the robot ensures the cuts match the plan perfectly.\n\nClosing up: Once the new knee components are in place and everything looks good, the incision is closed with sutures or staples. You’ll have a dressing (bandage) applied over the incision. The whole process is meticulous but efficient in Dr. Naveen’s experienced hands. Right after surgery, you’ll be moved to a recovery area where nurses and doctors monitor you as you wake up from anesthesia.\n\nPain management: Even before you wake up, we take steps to manage pain. Often, Dr. Naveen or the anesthesiology team will put a nerve block (an injection to numb nerves in the leg) or inject local anesthetic around the knee during surgery. This greatly reduces post-op pain in the first day or two. You’ll also be given IV pain medications as needed. Our goal is to keep you comfortable – some pain is normal after any surgery, but we keep it at a tolerable level so you can start moving and rehabbing quickly.\n\nAfter Surgery: Recovery and Rehabilitation\n\nCongratulations – you have a new knee! Now the focus shifts to recovery and helping you get the most out of your knee replacement. Here’s what happens after the operation:\n\nIn the hospital: You will stay in the hospital for a short period after surgery. Many patients spend about 2–4 days in the hospital​, though this can vary.\n\nOn Day 1 (the same evening or next morning after surgery), physiotherapists will start working with you. Initially, it’s gentle movements: wiggling your toes, moving your ankles, and doing static exercises like pressing the back of your knee down into the bed (to engage your thigh muscles). These help improve circulation and prevent stiffness.\n\nBy Day 2, most patients will sit up and dangle their legs at the bedside and even take a few steps with a walker under supervision​. Don’t be surprised – yes, we get you up and walking very soon after knee replacement! Early movement is key to preventing blood clots and speeding recovery. You’ll have a drip for fluids and maybe a drain in your knee (to remove any excess fluid from the joint area) for a day. Nurses will give you medications to manage pain and prevent clots (usually a blood thinner injection or pill).\n\nRehabilitation and physiotherapy: Physical therapy is your best friend after knee replacement. Our expert physiotherapists will guide you through exercises to gradually increase your knee’s range of motion and strengthen the muscles. Initially, it might be a bit challenging, but each day gets better. You’ll practice bending the knee more each day (usually aiming for at least 90 degrees bend before leaving hospital) and strengthening exercises like gentle leg lifts. By the time you’re discharged, you will be walking with a walker or crutches on your own for short distances (like around the room or hallway). We’ll teach you how to safely climb stairs with assistance if needed (typically: “up with the good leg, down with the operated leg” using support).\n\nGoing home: Most people go home after their hospital stay; some might go to a short-term rehab facility if extra help is needed (though with our robust home physiotherapy network, that’s rarely necessary). At home, you will continue physiotherapy — either with a professional coming to your home or by visiting our center periodically, depending on what’s convenient. You’ll have some staples or stitches on your incision that will be removed about 2 weeks after surgery (we’ll schedule a follow-up for that). During the first 2-3 weeks, you’ll likely use a walker, then progress to a cane, and eventually walk without support when you feel steady (often by around 2-3 weeks you can walk short distances without the walker​, and by 4-6 weeks more confidently).\n\nPain and medication: It’s normal to have moderate pain for a few weeks, but it improves steadily. We will prescribe pain relief tablets that you can take as needed. Many patients find their pain is well controlled with medications by the end of week 1 or 2. The knee might be swollen for a few weeks – icing and elevating the leg help reduce swelling. Keep in mind, the “pain after knee replacement” is temporary and very manageable, and it’s different from the arthritis pain you had (post-surgery pain lessens week by week, whereas arthritis pain would only worsen without surgery). We’ll also guide you on wound care and signs of any issues to watch (though problems are uncommon, we stay proactive).\n\nFollow-ups: You’ll have regular follow-up appointments with Dr. Naveen – usually at 2 weeks (for stitch removal and check-up), 6 weeks, 3 months, and so on. During these visits, we check your range of motion (most patients get back to 120-130 degrees bend eventually), and take X-rays to ensure the implants are in good position. Dr. Naveen will also discuss gradually resuming activities. By 6 weeks, many patients are walking without a cane and doing most daily activities like shopping or light housekeeping. By 3 months, you should be doing very well – walking longer distances, climbing stairs better, and maybe doing gentle exercises like stationary cycling or swimming. Over 6-12 months, any residual stiffness keeps improving. You can expect to return to an active lifestyle – not high-impact sports, but things like walking, golf, cycling, yoga are typically fine (and encouraged!). Your new knee won’t prevent you from traveling or enjoying hobbies; it’s there to enable those things with far less pain than before.\n\nA new lease on life: Most people find that by 3 to 6 months post-op, they hardly think about their knee anymore – it just works. They can walk without limping, climb stairs normally, and most importantly, they have relief from the constant pain that plagued them. You’ll likely wonder why you didn’t do it sooner! We’ve had patients tell us that knee replacement was “life-changing” – being able to play with grandkids, take morning walks in the park, or even go on trekking vacations that were impossible before. Our team will continue to be a resource for you even after you’re fully recovered. We’re just a phone call away if you have questions during rehab or even years later.\n\nYour commitment: Successful recovery does require some effort from your side – mainly doing your physiotherapy exercises and staying active as advised. Think of it as a partnership: Dr. Naveen provides a brand new knee, and you put in the work to make it strong and functional. Don’t worry, we’ll support you throughout. And remember, every patient’s recovery timeline is a little different – so don’t be discouraged if your friend was off the walker in 2 weeks and you take 4 weeks. Steady progress is what matters, and we’ll ensure you keep moving forward.\n\nTestimonials\n\nI suffered from knee arthritis for years and was hesitant about surgery. But after meeting Dr. Naveen, I felt confident to go ahead. He performed a total knee replacement on my right knee, and the results are amazing! Within a month, I was walking without support and climbing stairs with minimal discomfort. Now, three months later, I can go for my morning walks again – pain-free! Dr. Naveen is the best knee surgeon I could have asked for, and his team was caring and professional throughout. Thank you for giving me my active life back\n\nS. Ramesh\n\nIndiranagar, Bangalore\n\nAfter trying physiotherapy and injections for my knee pain, I finally decided to undergo knee replacement with Dr. Naveen. The surgery went smoothly and the care I received was top-notch. I was home in three days and the physiotherapist helped me regain strength week by week. It’s been 8 weeks now, and I can honestly say I feel 10 years younger. I can walk longer distances and even enjoy gardening without crippling pain. My only regret is not doing it sooner! Dr. Naveen truly lives up to his reputation as one of the best joint replacement surgeons in Bangalore.\n\nAnita Gupta\n\nKoramangala, Bangalore\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhen is knee arthritis surgery (total knee replacement) needed?\n\nKnee replacement is typically recommended when arthritis has severely damaged the knee joint and conservative treatments (like medications, injections, physiotherapy, bracing) no longer provide relief. Signs that you might need this surgery include chronic pain even at rest or at night, major trouble with mobility (like difficulty walking or climbing stairs), and X-rays showing advanced arthritis (bone rubbing on bone). Essentially, if your knee pain is reducing your quality of life and you’ve tried other treatments without success, it may be time to consider total knee replacement. It’s often called “arthritis knee surgery” because it is the definitive solution for end-stage knee arthritis. Dr. Naveen will assess your condition thoroughly – if you’re in early stages of arthritis, he might suggest non-surgical measures; if you’re in an advanced stage (Stage 3 or 4 arthritis), knee replacement can significantly improve your pain and function.\n\nHow do I choose the best knee replacement surgeon in Bangalore for my surgery?\n\nChoosing a surgeon can be confusing with so many options. Here are a few tips: look for a surgeon’s experience and credentials (how many knee replacements have they done? are they specialized in joint replacement? do they have advanced training or international fellowships?). Patient testimonials and reviews can tell you about others’ experiences. It’s also important that you feel comfortable with the surgeon – do they listen to your concerns and explain things clearly? In Bangalore, you’ll find several renowned orthopedic surgeons. Dr. Naveen Kumar L.V. is often cited among the best knee surgeons in Bangalore, given his extensive training in the UK, 24+ years of experience, and hundreds of happy patient outcomes. He is a joint replacement surgeon who focuses not just on the surgical procedure but also on your pre- and post-operative care (which is just as important for success). Ultimately, the “best” surgeon for you will be someone who is highly skilled and whom you trust. We encourage you to have a consultation, ask questions, and then make an informed decision. (Our patients frequently mention that Dr. Naveen’s approachable nature and clear explanations were a big factor in choosing him.)\n\nIs knee replacement surgery painful? What about pain after the surgery?\n\nIt’s normal to worry about pain – nobody likes to suffer! The good news is that while you will have some pain after knee replacement, it is manageable and temporary. During the surgery, you won’t feel anything due to anesthesia. After surgery, modern pain management techniques ensure you stay as comfortable as possible. At Sports Orthopedics, we use a combination of methods: nerve blocks, epidurals or spinal anesthesia, and pain medications. Most patients rate their pain as moderate in the first few days, improving quickly over the first 1-2 weeks. Pain after knee replacement is often different from the arthritis pain you had – surgical pain diminishes each day, whereas arthritis pain would have persisted or worsened without surgery. We’ll provide you with medications (like anti-inflammatories and mild opioids if needed) to control pain, and our team will monitor you closely. By around two weeks, many patients are on simple painkillers or even just occasional tablets. Also, remember that physical therapy helps reduce pain in the long run by strengthening muscles and improving flexibility. So yes, there is some discomfort after surgery, but we make sure it’s well-controlled. And most importantly, that post-op pain is a sign of healing and will soon be replaced by the absence of the old crippling knee pain.\n\nHow soon can I walk after knee replacement surgery?\n\nMuch sooner than most people expect! In our protocol (and many modern hospitals), patients begin walking with assistance within a day or two after surgery​. Typically, the day after your surgery, you’ll stand up and take a few steps with a walker under the guidance of a physiotherapist. By the second day, you’re likely walking to the bathroom or down the corridor with support. Early walking is encouraged because it kickstarts your recovery – it helps blood circulation and prevents stiffness. Of course, you won’t be jogging right away – you’ll use a walker or crutches for a couple of weeks for stability. Most patients can walk independently (without a walker) by around 2-3 weeks after a total knee replacement​, and with a cane if needed for a bit longer. Each person’s timeline is slightly different, but the key point is: you won’t be bedridden. Our goal is to get you back on your feet safely and quickly. By 6 weeks, you’ll likely be walking normally (perhaps even earlier for partial knee replacements). Dr. Naveen and the physio team will ensure you have the confidence and strength to walk as early as possible, while always prioritizing safety to avoid falls.\n\nWhat is the typical recovery time, and when can I get back to normal life?\n\nRecovery from knee replacement happens in stages. The initial recovery (hospital stay and first two weeks) is focused on healing the incision and getting basic mobility with a walker. By about 4-6 weeks, most patients have made big strides: the surgical wound has healed, pain is much less, knee movement is improving (you might be bending 90-120°), and you can do many daily activities like walking around the house, shopping, or light chores. By 3 months, you’ll likely feel pretty “normal” – you can walk longer distances, climb stairs with alternate feet, and have returned to hobbies like swimming or cycling (low-impact activities). Many people are able to resume work (if it’s a desk job, even earlier – around 4-6 weeks; if it’s a more active job, closer to 2-3 months). Full recovery – in terms of strength and endurance – can take up to 6 months to a year. This is when you see the last bits of improvement in muscle strength and fine tuning of balance. Remember, everyone’s timeline is a bit different. Age and fitness level play a role – a younger, fit person might bounce back faster, whereas someone older or with other health issues may progress more gradually. The great thing is, knee replacement continues to improve your comfort and ability for up to a year post-op, so even if you’re not 100% at 3 months, you will likely be even better at 6 or 12 months. And “normal life” is the goal – things like walking without fear of pain, enjoying outings, traveling, and playing with grandkids become easy again. Dr. Naveen will give you specific guidance on any activities to avoid (for example, we generally advise against high-impact pounding activities like running or jumping to protect the new knee). But for most patients, by a few months after surgery, you’re back to doing almost everything you love – just without the pain\n\nHow long will my knee implant last? Will I ever need another surgery?\n\nKnee implants are quite durable. Most knee replacements last 15-20 years or more​. In fact, studies show that about 90% of knee replacements are still functioning well 15 years post-surgery, and around 80-85% last 20-25 years or longer​. This means if you get a knee replacement in your 60s or 70s, it will likely serve you for the rest of your life. If you are younger (say, in your 40s or 50s) when you get the surgery, you may outlive your implant and need a revision in the distant future. The need for a second surgery (revision) depends on factors like how much you use your knee, your weight, and whether any complications occur. The most common reason for a very long-term failure is wear and tear – the plastic spacer can wear down over time. But with modern materials and better techniques (like improved alignment via robotic surgery), implants are lasting longer than ever. Dr. Naveen uses high-quality, proven implants designed for longevity. We also schedule check-ups every couple of years even long after recovery, to monitor your knee. If a problem ever arises (like loosening or increasing pain after many years), we catch it early. The bottom line is, knee replacement is a long-lasting solution for arthritis – for the vast majority of patients it is a one-time surgery that provides decades of relief. And should you ever require a revision, you’ll be in expert hands, as Dr. Naveen is experienced in complex revision surgeries too.",

      "content_html": "<p>Are you struggling with severe knee pain that makes every step a challenge? Imagine having a knee replacement surgery so precise that you recover faster and get back to the activities you love sooner. Robotic knee replacement surgery is a cutting-edge procedure that can make this possible. It combines advanced robotic technology with the skill of a surgeon to perform knee replacement with exceptional accuracy. For patients, this means a more personalized fit of the new knee joint, often resulting in less pain and a quicker recovery compared to traditional methods. If you’re looking for a Robotic Knee Replacement Surgeon in Bangalore, Dr. Naveen Kumar is a leading expert who can help. He uses state-of-the-art robotic systems along with years of orthopedic experience to ensure the best outcome for each patient.</p>\n<p>In a robotic knee replacement, the surgeon remains in full control, but the robotic system provides real-time guidance and feedback. Think of it as a high-tech assistant: it helps Dr. Naveen plan the surgery tailored to your knee’s unique anatomy and ensures that the implant is positioned with pinpoint precision. Whether you need a robotic total knee replacement (replacing the entire knee joint) or a robotic partial knee replacement (replacing only the damaged part of the knee), this technology allows for an incredibly accurate procedure. Importantly, knee replacement is one of the most effective surgeries for relieving pain and restoring mobility​. Robotic assistance takes this proven procedure to the next level by improving surgical accuracy and consistency for even better results. In the sections below, we explain when robotic knee replacement is needed, its benefits, what the surgery involves, the recovery process, and why Dr. Naveen Kumar is the right choice for robotic knee surgery in Bangalore.</p>\n<h3>Extensive Orthopedic Experience</h3>\n<h3>Pioneer in Robotic Knee Surgery</h3>\n<h3>Sports Orthopedics Specialty</h3>\n<h3>International Training & Credentials</h3>\n<h3>Patient-Centered Care</h3>\n<h3>Convenient Location</h3>\n<p>Robotic-assisted knee surgery offers several advantages over the conventional knee replacement technique. Here are some key benefits that patients appreciate:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Unmatched Precision: The robotic system helps the surgeon make extremely accurate bone cuts and implant placements. This level of precision ensures your new knee components are aligned perfectly to your unique anatomy, which is difficult to achieve by hand alone.</li>\n  <li>Personalized Fit & Alignment: Before surgery, the robotic technology creates a 3D model of your knee and assists in planning. This means the surgery is tailored to your knee’s exact structure. A better alignment and custom fit can improve how your knee moves (greater range of motion) and how natural it feels after recovery​.</li>\n  <li>Less Pain & Tissue Protection: Robotic assistance allows for very targeted bone removal, preserving as much healthy bone and soft tissue as possible. By avoiding unnecessary trauma to muscles and ligaments, patients often experience less post-operative pain and swelling. This tissue-sparing approach also means you may need smaller doses of pain medication after surgery.</li>\n  <li>Faster Recovery: Because of the precision and reduced tissue damage, many patients find they recover more quickly. You may be able to start walking with support sooner, and some patients even go home the same day of the surgery or with just an overnight stay. A quicker recovery means getting back to your normal activities and lifestyle faster than with traditional surgery.</li>\n  <li>Improved Implant Longevity: When a knee implant is placed in optimal alignment, it tends to wear more evenly. This can extend the life of the implant, giving you many years (or even decades) of improved knee function. In short, a well-aligned knee replacement done with robotic guidance can remain comfortable and stable for a longer time, reducing the likelihood that you’ll need a revision surgery later on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By combining these benefits, robotic knee surgery not only aims to relieve your pain but also helps ensure that your new knee joint feels as natural as possible. Better accuracy during surgery can translate into better function in daily life – from walking and using stairs to returning to hobbies like golf or cycling, many patients report feeling more confident on their new knee.</p>\n<h2>Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery Procedure</h2>\n<p>If you’re considering a robotic knee replacement, it helps to know what happens during the procedure. While the idea of a “robot” might sound intimidating, rest assured that the surgeon – not the robot – is in charge every step of the way. The robotic system is a sophisticated tool that assists Dr. Naveen in performing your surgery with enhanced accuracy. Here’s an overview of how the procedure typically works:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Comprehensive Planning: Before the surgery day, detailed images (such as a CT scan or special MRI) of your knee may be taken. This data is used to create a 3D model of your knee joint. Dr. Naveen uses this model with the robotic software to plan the surgery virtually. He can determine the exact size and position of the implant and how much bone needs to be removed – all before making any incisions. This thorough planning ensures there are no surprises during the operation.</li>\n  <li>Precise Bone Preparation: On the day of surgery, after you are properly anesthetized, Dr. Naveen will use the robotic arm to assist in removing the damaged bone and cartilage from your knee. The robot provides real-time feedback and guidance, ensuring that only the intended areas are removed. It acts like a GPS for your knee, helping the surgeon stay on the exact cutting path defined in the plan. This means the bone cuts are extremely precise, down to a fraction of a millimeter.</li>\n  <li>Implant Placement: Once the damaged portions are removed, the new artificial knee components (the implant) are ready to be placed. The robotic system assists in positioning the implant at the perfect angle and depth. Dr. Naveen guides the implant into place while the robot confirms the alignment is just right according to the 3D plan. This step is crucial because proper alignment and balance of the knee implant will affect how well your knee functions.</li>\n  <li>Verification & Adjustment: One of the great advantages of the robotic system is that it allows the surgeon to double-check everything in real time. Dr. Naveen will test the range of motion of your new knee and verify the alignment and ligament balance. If any fine-tuning is needed (for example, adjusting the tension of the knee ligaments or the position of the implant by a millimeter), the system helps guide those adjustments. This ensures that by the end of the surgery, your knee replacement is as stable and smooth-moving as possible.</li>\n  <li>Closing & Recovery: After the implant is perfectly in place and all checks are complete, Dr. Naveen will close the surgical incision. A dressing is applied to protect the area. Thanks to the pre-planning and robotic guidance, the procedure is highly efficient. In many cases, the surgery time is comparable to a regular knee replacement, and sometimes even shorter because there’s less guesswork. You’ll then be moved to a recovery room where you wake up from anesthesia. The medical team will monitor you and start pain relief measures. Many patients start gentle knee movements or even stand with assistance on the same day of surgery.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Throughout the procedure, the robotic technology adds an extra layer of accuracy and safety. It does not replace the surgeon – instead, it augments the surgeon’s skill. The result is a knee replacement that is done “right” the first time, with a focus on perfecting the details that matter for your recovery.</p>\n<h2>Recovery Timeline After Robotic Knee Replacement</h2>\n<p>Recovery from a robotic knee replacement is very similar to recovery from a traditional knee replacement, but you may achieve milestones slightly faster thanks to the minimally invasive, precise nature of the procedure. Every patient’s healing process is a little different, but here’s a general timeline of what to expect after your surgery:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Day 0 – Hospital Stay: Right after surgery, you’ll rest and recover from anesthesia. The healthcare team will manage your pain and monitor you. Because robotic techniques can reduce tissue trauma, some patients are able to go home the same day of the surgery or after one night​. In other cases, you may stay in the hospital for about 1–2 days. During this time, a physiotherapist will help you gently start moving your new knee (often within hours of surgery) and even help you stand up with a walker on the first day.</li>\n  <li>First 2 Weeks – Early Recovery: At home, the focus is on pain control and gradual increase in movement. You will continue physical therapy exercises to improve your knee’s range of motion. By the end of the first week, many patients can walk short distances at home with a walker or crutches. You’ll likely be able to bear weight on the leg as tolerated (the knee joint itself is stable right away because of the implant). Keep the surgical area clean and dry – the stitches or staples are usually removed around 2 weeks after surgery.</li>\n  <li>Weeks 3–6 – Gaining Strength: As you progress with physiotherapy, your leg muscles grow stronger and your knee becomes more flexible. Around 3 to 4 weeks, many patients transition from a walker to a cane, and some may walk unaided for short periods if balance and strength allow. You’ll find it easier to do daily activities like getting in/out of a chair or car. By 6 weeks, most patients can walk with minimal or no support and can handle stairs with the help of a handrail. If you have a desk job, you might even be back to work by this time (always depending on your comfort and your doctor’s advice).</li>\n  <li>2–3 Months – Resuming Normal Activities: Approximately 8 to 12 weeks after surgery, you should see a big improvement in your knee function. At this stage, you’re usually able to walk longer distances without pain and you won’t need any support. Many people are cleared to drive again (typically after about 6 weeks, once you have good control of your leg). You can return to low-impact activities you enjoy, such as swimming, cycling, or golf, as advised by Dr. Naveen. Thanks to the robotic surgery’s precision, your knee may feel more natural during movement, and you can trust that it’s securely in place.</li>\n  <li>Beyond 3 Months – Long-Term Recovery: Every individual heals at their own pace, but by 3 months many patients feel pretty “normal” in terms of daily activities. Minor swelling may come and go for a few months, and strength improvements can continue for up to a year. The scar will also mature and fade over time. Dr. Naveen will schedule follow-up visits to check your knee’s progress. The ultimate reward is that you’ll be able to do things that were difficult before – whether it’s taking long walks, playing with grandchildren, or exercising – without the crippling knee pain you once had.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout your recovery, Dr. Naveen’s team will guide you on exercises and precautions. Robotic knee surgery can make the recovery a bit smoother, but your commitment to physiotherapy and rehabilitation is equally important for the best outcome. Remember, a successful recovery is a partnership – the surgical precision of the robot and surgeon sets the stage, and your active participation in rehab completes the picture.</p>\n<h2>Areas We Commonly Serve in Bangalore</h2>\n<p>Dr. Naveen’s reputation attracts patients from all across the city.

Imagine having a knee replacement surgery so precise that you recover faster and get back to the activities you love sooner. Robotic knee replacement surgery is a cutting-edge procedure that can make this possible. It combines advanced robotic technology with the skill of a surgeon to perform knee replacement with exceptional accuracy. For patients, this means a more personalized fit of the new knee joint, often resulting in less pain and a quicker recovery compared to traditional methods. If you’re looking for a Robotic Knee Replacement Surgeon in Bangalore, Dr. Naveen Kumar is a leading expert who can help. He uses state-of-the-art robotic systems along with years of orthopedic experience to ensure the best outcome for each patient.\n\nIn a robotic knee replacement, the surgeon remains in full control, but the robotic system provides real-time guidance and feedback. Think of it as a high-tech assistant: it helps Dr. Naveen plan the surgery tailored to your knee’s unique anatomy and ensures that the implant is positioned with pinpoint precision. Whether you need a robotic total knee replacement (replacing the entire knee joint) or a robotic partial knee replacement (replacing only the damaged part of the knee), this technology allows for an incredibly accurate procedure. Importantly, knee replacement is one of the most effective surgeries for relieving pain and restoring mobility​. Robotic assistance takes this proven procedure to the next level by improving surgical accuracy and consistency for even better results. In the sections below, we explain when robotic knee replacement is needed, its benefits, what the surgery involves, the recovery process, and why Dr. Naveen Kumar is the right choice for robotic knee surgery in Bangalore.\n\nWhy Choose Dr. Naveen Kumar for Robotic Knee Surgery in Bangalore\n\nWhen it comes to something as important as your knee health, you want to make sure you’re in the best hands. Dr. Naveen Kumar (MBBS, MS Ortho, FRCS Orth [UK]) is a highly acclaimed orthopedic surgeon in Bangalore, and patients trust him for good reason.

Here are some key benefits that patients appreciate:\n\nUnmatched Precision: The robotic system helps the surgeon make extremely accurate bone cuts and implant placements. This level of precision ensures your new knee components are aligned perfectly to your unique anatomy, which is difficult to achieve by hand alone.\n\nPersonalized Fit & Alignment: Before surgery, the robotic technology creates a 3D model of your knee and assists in planning. This means the surgery is tailored to your knee’s exact structure. A better alignment and custom fit can improve how your knee moves (greater range of motion) and how natural it feels after recovery​.\n\nLess Pain & Tissue Protection: Robotic assistance allows for very targeted bone removal, preserving as much healthy bone and soft tissue as possible. By avoiding unnecessary trauma to muscles and ligaments, patients often experience less post-operative pain and swelling. This tissue-sparing approach also means you may need smaller doses of pain medication after surgery.\n\nFaster Recovery: Because of the precision and reduced tissue damage, many patients find they recover more quickly. You may be able to start walking with support sooner, and some patients even go home the same day of the surgery or with just an overnight stay. A quicker recovery means getting back to your normal activities and lifestyle faster than with traditional surgery.\n\nImproved Implant Longevity: When a knee implant is placed in optimal alignment, it tends to wear more evenly. This can extend the life of the implant, giving you many years (or even decades) of improved knee function. In short, a well-aligned knee replacement done with robotic guidance can remain comfortable and stable for a longer time, reducing the likelihood that you’ll need a revision surgery later on.\n\nBy combining these benefits, robotic knee surgery not only aims to relieve your pain but also helps ensure that your new knee joint feels as natural as possible. Better accuracy during surgery can translate into better function in daily life – from walking and using stairs to returning to hobbies like golf or cycling, many patients report feeling more confident on their new knee.\n\nRobotic Knee Replacement Surgery Procedure\n\nIf you’re considering a robotic knee replacement, it helps to know what happens during the procedure.

Thank you, doctor, for your expertise and care\n\nLakshmi P\n\nIndiranagar, Bangalore\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is robotic knee replacement surgery?\n\nRobotic knee replacement surgery is a modern approach to knee replacement where the surgeon uses a robotic-assisted system to perform the operation. In a conventional knee replacement, the surgeon relies on manual instruments and their experience to align and place the new knee parts. In a robotic procedure, a computer-guided robotic arm helps the surgeon by providing extremely precise measurements and control. The process usually starts with a detailed 3D map of your knee, which helps plan exactly how much bone to remove and where to place the implant. During surgery, the robot acts as a guide, it ensures that Dr. Naveen stays perfectly on course according to the plan. It’s important to know that the robot does not replace the surgeon or operate on its own. Dr. Naveen is in charge at all times, directing the robotic arm as needed. The result is the same goal as a traditional knee replacement, to remove the damaged portions of the knee and insert an artificial joint, but done with a level of accuracy that wasn’t possible before. For patients, this means a more exact fit of the implant, potentially less pain after surgery, and a quicker recovery.\n\nWhat are the advantages of robotic knee replacement over traditional surgery?\n\nRobotic knee replacement offers several advantages. First, it provides enhanced precision, the robotic system can execute the surgical plan with sub-millimeter accuracy, which is hard to achieve with the human hand alone. This leads to better alignment of the knee implant and a more balanced knee joint​. With robotic assistance, there’s also often less damage to surrounding tissues, because the cuts are very controlled. This can translate into less bleeding and less pain right after surgery. Many patients who have robotic surgery recover faster and regain normal knee function sooner than those who have a traditional knee replacement, thanks to the precise implantation​. In the long run, the improved alignment can help the implant last longer with lower risk of wear. That said, it’s important to note that traditional knee replacement is also a highly successful surgery, robotic technology simply refines the process. By choosing a robotic approach with an experienced surgeon, you’re stacking the odds in favor of an optimal outcome and a smoother rehabilitation.\n\nWho is a good candidate for robotic knee replacement?\n\nIf you are a candidate for a regular knee replacement, you are generally a candidate for a robotic knee replacement. Typically, this surgery is recommended for people suffering from severe knee arthritis (osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis) or significant knee joint damage that causes chronic pain and limits daily activities. Age by itself is not a strict criterion, patients ranging from mid-40s to 80s have had successful robotic knee surgeries. What matters more is the extent of knee damage and your overall health. Before recommending surgery, Dr. Naveen will assess your symptoms, perform a physical exam, and review X-rays or MRI of your knee. He’ll also consider whether you have tried non-surgical treatments (like medications, injections, bracing, or physiotherapy). If those treatments haven’t given you relief and your knee pain is affecting your quality of life, you could be a good candidate. Both total knee replacements (for widespread arthritis) and partial knee replacements (for damage in just one part of the knee) can be done with robotic assistance. Dr. Naveen will determine which approach is suitable for you. As always, the final decision is made after a thorough consultation, where you can discuss the risks, benefits, and any concerns before proceeding.\n\nHow long does it take to recover from a robotic knee replacement?\n\nRecovery time can vary from person to person, but generally the timeline for robotic knee replacement is quite similar to that of traditional knee surgery, with the potential for a somewhat faster early recovery. Most patients will be up and taking a few steps (with a walker or crutches) within 24 hours of the surgery. In the first 2 weeks, you focus on controlling pain and doing gentle exercises. By 4-6 weeks, many patients can walk without major assistance and handle day-to-day tasks comfortably. With robotic surgery, some people report that they regained mobility a little quicker, possibly because of less soft tissue damage during the operation. By about 3 months post-op, the majority of patients are able to do most of their normal activities, like walking longer distances, climbing stairs, or even playing low-impact sports. Keep in mind that rehabilitation is key, doing your recommended physiotherapy exercises will greatly influence how fast and well you recover. Dr. Naveen and the physio team will give you a personalized rehab plan. Also, individual factors (such as age, fitness level, and whether you had other health issues) can affect recovery. Overall, whether robotic or not, knee replacement is a life-changing surgery and within a few months you should be feeling a lot less pain and much more mobile than before surgery.\n\nIs robotic knee replacement surgery safe?\n\nYes, robotic knee replacement is very safe. The procedure has been approved by medical authorities and has been used successfully in thousands of patients. Remember, the “robot” is a tool, it doesn’t make decisions on its own. Dr. Naveen controls every movement, and the technology simply provides guidance to enhance accuracy. Think of it like a very advanced GPS for surgery: it helps navigate but doesn’t drive the car by itself. Because of the improved precision, there is actually less room for error, which can increase the overall safety of the procedure. The risk of complications like improper implant placement is reduced. All the standard safety protocols of knee replacement surgery (such as preventing infection, careful anesthesia, etc.) remain the same. Dr. Naveen and his surgical team are highly trained in using the equipment and will take excellent care of you. As with any major surgery, there are general risks (like blood clots or infection), but these are not increased by the use of the robot. In fact, patients often have very good outcomes with robotic surgery, and many report high satisfaction with the procedure. Rest assured, you will be monitored closely throughout the process, and every measure is taken to ensure a safe surgery and recovery.\n\nWhat is the cost of robotic knee replacement surgery in Bangalore?\n\nThe cost of robotic knee replacement in Bangalore can vary depending on several factors. These factors include the hospital or surgical center fees, the type of implant used, the specific robotic system, and any additional services like physiotherapy or extra hospital stay. In general, robotic procedures may cost slightly more than traditional knee replacement because of the advanced equipment and technology involved. However, many patients feel that the potential benefits, such as a more precise fit, less pain, and faster recovery, are well worth it. Dr. Naveen’s clinic can provide you with a detailed cost estimate after evaluating your case. During your consultation, feel free to ask about the costs, insurance coverage, and payment options. We strive to be transparent and help you understand the expenses upfront. Keep in mind that investing in a high-quality procedure can save costs in the long run by reducing the likelihood of complications or revision surgeries. Our team will also guide you on insurance approvals and any paperwork needed. While cost is an important consideration, remember that the expertise of the surgeon and the quality of care are crucial for a successful outcome. With Dr. Naveen, you’ll be getting top-notch care and advanced technology, ensuring you get excellent value for the cost of your treatment.",

These conditions, if left untreated, can significantly impair mobility and overall quality of life. Understanding these conditions in depth can help you recognize symptoms early and seek timely medical care.</p>\n<h3>1. Osteoarthritis of the Hip</h3>\n<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common reason for hip replacement. It is a degenerative joint disease that causes the cartilage cushioning the bones to wear away over time. As the cartilage deteriorates, the bones rub against each other, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Patients often experience difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or performing daily activities. Osteoarthritis usually develops with age but can be accelerated by prior injuries or a sedentary lifestyle.</p>\n<h3>2. Avascular Necrosis (AVN) of the Hip</h3>\n<p>Also known as osteonecrosis, AVN occurs when blood supply to the femoral head (the ball of the hip joint) is disrupted, leading to bone death and structural collapse. AVN can develop due to trauma, long-term steroid use, alcohol abuse, or unknown causes. Early stages may present as mild discomfort, but the pain intensifies as the condition progresses, eventually requiring surgical intervention. If diagnosed early, AVN may be managed with joint-preserving techniques; however, advanced cases often necessitate total hip replacement.</p>\n<h3>3. Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3>\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that causes chronic inflammation of the joint lining, resulting in pain, swelling, and joint erosion. Unlike osteoarthritis, which is due to wear and tear, rheumatoid arthritis is systemic and can affect multiple joints. In the hip, it leads to stiffness, persistent discomfort, and structural damage. THR is often recommended when medications and physical therapy no longer provide relief.</p>\n<h3>4. Post-Traumatic Arthritis</h3>\n<p>This form of arthritis results from previous injury to the hip joint — such as a fracture, dislocation, or ligament damage. The trauma disrupts joint alignment and damages cartilage, which accelerates degenerative changes. Post-traumatic arthritis may not surface immediately but often manifests years after the original injury. Patients typically report persistent pain, reduced flexibility, and instability.</p>\n<h3>5. Infective Arthritis (Septic Arthritis)</h3>\n<p>Infective arthritis occurs when a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection invades the hip joint, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. It may occur due to bloodstream infections, surgeries, or injections around the joint. If not treated promptly, it can destroy the cartilage and joint surface, leaving patients with long-term stiffness and pain. In chronic or post-infective cases, hip replacement may be necessary to restore function.</p>\n<h3>6. Hip Dysplasia</h3>\n<p>Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a condition where the hip socket is abnormally shallow, making it difficult for the femoral head to stay in place. It is usually diagnosed in infancy but may remain unnoticed until adulthood when it presents as pain or limited movement. Dysplasia leads to early-onset arthritis due to joint instability. Surgical correction, including hip replacement, is often required in adults with advanced dysplasia-related degeneration.</p>\n<h3>Other Less Common Conditions</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Inflammatory Arthropathies: Such as lupus or ankylosing spondylitis</li>\n  <li>Paget’s Disease of Bone: A chronic bone disorder affecting joint integrity</li>\n  <li>Bone Tumors or Cysts: Rare but significant causes of joint destruction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each condition requires a tailored approach. At Sports Orthopedics, Dr. Naveen Kumar uses detailed diagnostic imaging and personalized treatment plans to determine the best course of action — whether it be conservative care, joint preservation, or total hip replacement surgery.</p>\n<p>If you’re experiencing hip discomfort or mobility issues, an accurate diagnosis is the first step toward recovery. Book a consultation with our specialist team to begin your journey toward a healthier, more mobile future.</p>\n<p>Understanding what to expect before, during, and after your total hip replacement can ease anxiety and help you prepare mentally and physically for a smooth recovery journey.</p>\n<h3>Before Surgery</h3>\n<p>Preparation begins with a thorough medical evaluation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A complete clinical assessment, along with X-rays or MRI, helps confirm the extent of joint damage and decide the implant type.</li>\n  <li>Your existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or anemia will be addressed and optimized to minimize surgical risk.</li>\n  <li>You’ll meet the anesthetist to decide between spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia based on your medical profile.</li>\n  <li>We recommend prehabilitation exercises, which are specific routines aimed at strengthening the muscles around your hip before surgery. This often results in quicker post-op recovery and better mobility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>During Surgery</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>The surgery typically takes 2 to 2.5 hours under sterile operation theater conditions.</li>\n  <li>The damaged femoral head (ball) and acetabulum (socket) are removed and replaced with prosthetic components made of metal, ceramic, and medical-grade plastic.</li>\n  <li>Based on age and bone quality, your surgeon will decide on cemented or cementless fixation.</li>\n  <li>After verifying joint alignment and mobility, the incision is closed with sutures or staples, and a sterile dressing is applied.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>After Surgery: Immediate Recovery</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Within 4 to 6 hours, patients are encouraged to begin gentle ankle pumps and foot movements to stimulate circulation and prevent clots.</li>\n  <li>On Day 1, you will receive assistance to sit upright and may begin bedside mobility or short walks with a walker under physiotherapist guidance.</li>\n  <li>Day 2 onwards, walking short distances with support and guided exercises begin.</li>\n  <li>Most patients are discharged by Day 3 to 5, depending on pain levels, wound healing, and confidence in walking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recovery Timeline at Home</h3>\n<p>se a walker for mobility, follow the home exercise program, get your wound checked and dressing changed around Day 10–12, and avoid twisting, bending forward, or sitting in low chairs.</p>\n<p>Week 3–6: Gradually shift from walker to stick, increase walking distance, begin light household chores, and start physiotherapy if advised.</p>\n<p>Week 6–12: Walk independently with ease, perform more advanced exercises, and resume light work or recreational activities.</p>\n<p>Month 3 and beyond:</p>\n<p>Resume most normal activities like driving, travel, and walking, while avoiding high-impact sports unless cleared for low-impact options like swimming, cycling, or yoga.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Hip Replacement Surgery in Bangalore</h2>\n<p>A successful Total Hip Replacement is more than just a surgical procedure — it’s often a turning point in a person’s life. Whether you’re suffering from osteoarthritis, AVN, or injury-related hip damage, the surgery can significantly enhance your physical function, mental well-being, and quality of life.</p>\n<p>At Sports Orthopedics Bangalore, Dr. Naveen Kumar has helped hundreds of patients walk pain-free again and reclaim their independence. Here’s how:</p>\n<h3>Say Goodbye to Persistent Hip and Groin Pain</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of hip replacement surgery is complete relief from chronic pain. Whether your pain is localized to the hip, groin, or radiates to the knee, replacing the damaged joint with a smooth-functioning implant eliminates the root cause of the discomfort.</p>\n<p>Patients who struggled for years with pain while walking, sitting, or sleeping often describe the transformation as “instant relief.”</p>\n<h3>Regain Lost Mobility and Improve Posture</h3>\n<p>Stiff hips limit your movement and affect your balance. After a hip replacement, patients often regain their ability to walk, bend, climb stairs, and even sit cross-legged — activities that were once impossible. Improved hip alignment also corrects posture issues and can reduce the need for walking aids over time.</p>\n<p>If you’re based in Bangalore and have been relying on a stick or walker due to stiffness or instability, hip replacement can help you walk confidently again.</p>\n<h3>Return to Everyday Activities — and the Ones You Love</h3>\n<p>Many of our patients return to doing things they had given up on for years: walking in the park, riding a two-wheeler, gardening, swimming, or even going on short treks.</p>\n<p>With guided physiotherapy and follow-ups, you can safely resume:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Long walks or nature trails in places like Lalbagh or Cubbon Park</li>\n  <li>Recreational sports like badminton or yoga6</li>\n  <li>Travel around Bangalore or outstation visits without discomfort</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your active life doesn’t have to end with hip pain — in fact, this surgery often marks the beginning of a more mobile future.</p>\n<h3>Correction of Leg Length Discrepancies</h3>\n<p>Chronic hip issues can sometimes cause a difference in leg length, which may affect gait and lead to lower back problems. During Total Hip Replacement surgery, such discrepancies are often corrected, or significantly reduced, helping restore your natural walking rhythm and symmetry.</p>\n<p>At Sports Orthopedics, we use advanced planning and surgical precision to ensure post-op alignment is optimal.</p>\n<h3>Long-Lasting, Durable Implants</h3>\n<p>Modern hip implants made from ceramic, titanium, or cobalt-chrome alloys are designed to last 15 to 25 years or more, depending on your lifestyle and bone health. This means that in most cases, the implant can serve you for life — especially if the surgery is done at the right time, before major bone damage occurs.</p>\n<p>Patients in their 40s, 50s, and even 60s often benefit long-term without requiring a revision.</p>\n<h3>Better Sleep and Emotional Health</h3>\n<p>Chronic pain often affects sleep quality and mental well-being. Many patients report improved sleep, less irritability, and a renewed sense of emotional stability within weeks of surgery.</p>\n<p>Getting a good night’s sleep, being able to walk without support, and regaining your independence can have a profound impact on mental health, especially for elderly patients who’ve been housebound or dependent on others for daily tasks.</p>\n<h3>Life-Changing Confidence and Freedom</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most powerful benefit is the confidence patients gain post-surgery. From being unable to walk across a room to confidently walking unaided into a family gathering — the shift is not just physical, but deeply emotional.</p>\n<p>S.

AVN can develop due to trauma, long-term steroid use, alcohol abuse, or unknown causes. Early stages may present as mild discomfort, but the pain intensifies as the condition progresses, eventually requiring surgical intervention. If diagnosed early, AVN may be managed with joint-preserving techniques; however, advanced cases often necessitate total hip replacement.\n\n3.

But after meeting Dr. Naveen, I felt confident to go ahead. He performed a total knee replacement on my right knee, and the results are amazing! Within a month, I was walking without support and climbing stairs with minimal discomfort. Now, three months later, I can go for my morning walks again – pain-free! Dr. Naveen is the best knee surgeon I could have asked for, and his team was caring and professional throughout. Thank you for giving me my active life back\n\nS. Ramesh\n\nIndiranagar, Bangalore\n\nAfter trying physiotherapy and injections for my knee pain, I finally decided to undergo knee replacement with Dr. Naveen. The surgery went smoothly and the care I received was top-notch. I was home in three days and the physiotherapist helped me regain strength week by week. It’s been 8 weeks now, and I can honestly say I feel 10 years younger. I can walk longer distances and even enjoy gardening without crippling pain. My only regret is not doing it sooner!

Can I resume daily activities after hip replacement?\n\nYes, the goal of hip replacement is to restore pain-free movement and help you return to your routine. Activities like walking, driving, sitting cross-legged, and light exercises are typically resumed gradually over 2–3 months. High-impact sports should be avoided unless cleared by your surgeon.\n\n6. How long do hip implants last? Will I need another surgery later?\n\nModern hip implants typically last 15 to 20 years or more, depending on your activity levels, weight, and health. Many patients live the rest of their lives without needing another surgery. However, if the implant loosens or wears out (known as implant failure), a revision hip replacement may be needed.\n\n7. What are the risks involved in Total Hip Replacement?\n\nWhile hip replacement is generally safe, like any surgery, there are some potential risks:\n\nInfection\n\nBlood clots\n\nImplant loosening\n\nDislocation\n\nLeg length difference\n\nChoosing an experienced hip surgeon in Bangalore significantly reduces the chances of complications.
