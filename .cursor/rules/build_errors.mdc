I have my website running seamlessly in local dev, yet I got some typer errors while running npm run build and have saved them to [errors.md](mdc:.cursor/errors.md) . I'd like you to deal one page at a time with data available in [errors.md](mdc:.cursor/errors.md) . SOlve those errors without destroying my codebase and ensure you do not disturb existing flow. 

Run npm run build and ensure that errors are reducing as you solve. 

Strictly do not destroy my codebase.
