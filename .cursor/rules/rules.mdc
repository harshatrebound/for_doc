We are building a feature list as discussed in [BookingPress_Features.md](mdc:BookingPress_Features.md)

We are only going to build one at a time without disturbing existing codebase and features. 

You will use Postgresql MCP as needed. 

Prefer simplistic codebase architecture without too much complexity. 

Ensure all code files are withing 200-300 lines, always refactor as necessary.

You will always follow the todo list created here [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md). Ensure you keep updating the file as we are progresssing. 

I do not want cookie cutter designs. You should design like a top figma designing expert.

Strictly update my [TODO.md](mdc:TODO.md) after each run

We are using Prisma for database and connections, my variables are added in .env

We are using MCP only here in dev server for data queries in this IDE.

Remember we already have front end modal for users to book appoointments with us.We are now only building backen admin panel actions
